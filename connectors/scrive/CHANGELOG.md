### Minor Changes

- 3b8533d: **zod is now a peer dependency.** Install it alongside these packages:

  ```sh
  npm install zod@^4.4.0
  ```

  Every package here hands out zod schemas that a consumer parses with, composes
  into their own, and that `mountOperations` reads `_zod.def` off to find pinned
  literals. Two copies of zod in one tree means an object made by one is not
  recognised by the other, and the symptom — `expected a Zod schema` — points
  nowhere near the cause. A peer dependency says _use the consumer's copy_.

  The declared range is `^4.4.0` rather than the exact version this repo builds
  against: a peer range should state what the code supports, and pinning it to
  `^4.4.3` would refuse a consumer on 4.4.0 for no reason.

  **A defect this found.** `@substrat-run/contract-tests` shipped **130
  `import("zod")` references in its published `.d.ts` while declaring zod
  nowhere.** It resolved only because contracts had zod as a regular dependency,
  which hoisted a copy into view — not a dependency, a coincidence. It now declares
  it. Two more of the same class turned up when the tree shifted: packages using
  `setTimeout`/`atob`/`btoa` — globals absent from `lib: ES2023` — compiling on an
  ambient `@types/node` nobody had declared.

  That is the general rule now enforced by `pnpm lint:deps`
  (`tools/declared-deps.mjs`) in CI: **every module a package references, in its
  source or its emitted `.d.ts`, must be one it declared.** The `.d.ts` half is the
  sharp one — TypeScript writes the original specifier into declarations however
  the source imported it, so re-exporting `z` through contracts still emits
  `import("zod")` into a dependent's types.

  **Why a lint rather than pnpm's own enforcement**, measured rather than assumed:
  `autoInstallPeers` (pnpm's default) turns a peer conflict into a silent second
  copy — with contracts peer-requiring `^4.4.3` and a consumer declaring `^3.23.0`,
  pnpm reported nothing, and `zod` did not appear once in the peer report even
  under `--strict-peer-dependencies`. And pnpm's peer checking does not reach
  `workspace:` links at all. Full reasoning in `docs/architecture/dependency-policy.md`.

  Internally, shared versions now come from a pnpm `catalog:` so one version is a
  single edit. The `pnpm` settings block moved from `package.json` to
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which is where pnpm 10 reads it — it had been ignored,
  with `overrides` surviving only because they were baked into the lockfile.

  Closes #742.

### Minor Changes

- 9208b4e: A signature request can carry **how a party is reached** — sealed to the
  connector, never readable in the spine (#687 item 1,
  `docs/architecture/signature-contact-carrier.md`).

  Every external signature this platform has ever sent has failed. The reason was
  not the auth level and never was: `connector-scrive` mapped each party to a role
  label — "Beställare" — and no address, so Scrive answered
  `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` and a document started with nobody to deliver
  it to. `ScriveParty.email` was declared, wired into the provider's `fields`
  array, and filled by nothing. This is its producer.

  **Why it took a design.** The obvious carrier — put the address on the event —
  is unavailable: `protocol.signatures-requested` lands in `_substrat_outbox` and
  `_substrat_platform_requests`, kernel rows a vertical may neither write nor
  erase, so anything a hosted vertical emits in plaintext stays plaintext in copies
  it cannot reach. The next obvious one — seal it under the per-subject keys — is
  impossible rather than merely awkward: those keys live in the directory, and a
  sandbox-clean vertical is architecturally on the far side of that boundary
  (§2 of the design derives it). And reading the contact back at egress deadlocks,
  because a connector runs _inside_ the scope's dispatch and re-entering the scope
  actor wedges it.

  What works is the gap in the middle: a scope may never hold a _secret_ key, and
  nothing says that about a _public_ one.

  - **`sealTo` / `openSealed` in the kernel** — the asymmetric sibling of
    `SecretBox`: ECDH P-256 → AES-256-GCM, a fresh ephemeral keypair per seal, and
    an envelope that is a `SealedSecret` so it carries `keyId`. A cell that cannot
    name its key can only ever have one, and every ciphertext already written
    becomes ambiguous the day a second exists. Rotation is deferred; the envelope
    that permits it is not.
  - **A keypair per connection.** The private half is sealed under the host
    `SecretBox` beside the credential and stored **keyId-indexed from day one**,
    even holding one member — widening a column into a set later is a migration
    against live connections. Minted on first ask, so a connection older than this
    feature acquires one by being asked rather than by being reconnected.
  - **The public half is projected into the scope**, on the channel that already
    carries entitlements, identity links and connection grants — not
    `configureInstance`, because a key in the config bag becomes a key in a
    settings form.
  - **`ctx.sealToConnection(provider, plaintext)`** — awaited _before_ `ctx.emit`,
    so `emit` stays synchronous and D-28 is untouched. **Fails closed and legibly**
    when no key has reached the scope: emitting a request with its addresses
    silently dropped is the invisible failure this exists to end.
  - **`conn.unseal(cell)`** at egress, on the connection for the same reason
    `fetch` and `openAttachment` are — key material never crosses into connector
    code.

  `engine-protocol` gains `partyContact { email?, mobile? }` on
  `signatureRequestParty` and migration `0005-party-contact`, which stores **only
  the ciphertext**. There is no plaintext column to clear later and no erasure
  story to write: the address is unreadable to the spine, to its backups and to
  `sealDump`'s output, because the key that opens it is in the directory.
  `piiClass` therefore stays `'none'` — see the migration's own note for why
  `'pseudonymous'` would be actively wrong rather than more honest.

  **No `personalNumber` field, and its absence is the decision.** #687 measured the
  premise and it is false: what a provider validates is that a BankID party _has_
  the field, not that it holds a value. An optional PII field on an engine surface
  is a carrier that exists.

  Two invariants ship with the carrier, both in `requestSignatures`, both refusing
  before anything freezes:

  - **A party that will be invited must be reachable.** Otherwise the provider
    refuses after the instance has already frozen, leaving an avtal that looks sent
    for signature and is not.
  - **A set with no counterparty is refused.** "The declared primary, else the
    FIRST" is a total function, so a one-party request never failed here — it
    failed at the provider, where that party had been made the _author_, and an
    author is never invited. In production that party was the customer.

  Verified against the Scrive **testbed**, not only the mock: a party carrying an
  address no longer draws `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` at either auth level,
  and a document with one starts and reaches `pending`. The connector tolerates an
  absent contact in both skew directions — an older engine sends none, an older
  connector strips the field — so neither combination is worse than today, which is
  that nothing works.

### Minor Changes

- 4eb532b: The signatory is sent the contract, not an attestation sheet (#711).

  `connector-scrive`'s `create` rendered its own document unconditionally: one page
  naming the template, the parties and the content hash. Honest paper for a
  hash-attestation model, and the wrong paper for a contract — what landed in a
  counterparty's inbox was a list of identifiers, and they were asked to sign it
  with BankID. There was no way for a caller to supply the real one.

  **The seam.** A vertical uploads its rendered document onto the protocol instance
  and names it when binding; the freeze event carries the id; the connector opens it
  and sends those bytes:

  ```ts
  const doc = await attachments.upload({ entity: { entityType: 'protocol', entityId }, … });
  await scope.invoke('protocol/bind-document', { instanceId, contentRef, contentHash,
                                                 documentAttachmentId: doc.id });
  ```

  Bind nothing and today's sheet goes out unchanged, byte for byte — a vertical that
  renders nothing keeps working with no change.

  **By id, never by search.** The return path lands the sealed _signed_ copy on the
  same instance, so a connector that picked "the document on this instance" could
  mail a counterparty their own signed contract to sign again. Naming an id makes
  that unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely, and removes the only real design
  question the issue raised.

  **What the platform was actually missing.** The attachment store has existed since
  #473 and this connector already wrote through it on the return path — but the
  outbound leg needed a read that did not exist, in two different ways:

  - on `adapter-sqlite` a connector runs INSIDE the scope's actor task
    (`dispatchExecutors` is called from within `enqueue`), and every verb of the
    ordinary attachment surface re-enqueues on that actor — so reading from a
    dispatch wedged the scope, silently, forever. `dispatchConnector` does _not_
    enqueue, so a naive implementation works on the routed path and hangs under
    `invoke`/`drainDue`. Pinned in `adapter-sqlite/test/connector-reads.test.ts`.

    The adapter is therefore _told_ which case it is in rather than assuming the
    worse one. Building the read reentrant everywhere would work, and would quietly
    drop the platform-dispatch path out of K-6 serialization: a read on the same
    SQLite connection while another task holds a transaction open sees that task's
    uncommitted rows. There is a test in which the actor is deliberately busy and
    the read must wait for it — that wait is the serialization, made visible.

  - on the hosted Cloudflare path only `upload` crossed the `/internal` connector
    seam, so the control plane held the credential while the vertical held the bytes.

  New in the kernel: **`ScopedConnectorConnection`** — what `ctx.connection(provider)`
  returns inside a dispatch — with **`openAttachment(id)`**: reads only, by id only,
  gated by the target's `readPermission` against that connection's own grants.

  It hangs off the connection rather than the context deliberately, and the first cut
  of this change got it wrong in a way worth recording. Authorizing the read against
  an ambient "the provider this connector is registered under" is a _second name_ for
  the credential the handler already holds, and two names for one fact is how they come
  to disagree: `registerScriveConnector({ id: 'scrive-eu' })` opens its credential as
  `'scrive'` and would have read as `'scrive-eu'` — the egress half kept working while
  every contract's document half failed with `no live 'scrive-eu' connection`. Handing
  the door to whoever holds the credential makes that unrepresentable, and removes the
  ambient-provider plumbing (and a `dispatchConnector` option) entirely. A connection
  reopened _outside_ a dispatch — a credential probe, a poll driver — has no scope to
  read from and stays a plain `ConnectorConnection`, so the type says which is which
  instead of handing out a method that would have to throw.

  `ConnectorDelegation` gains `openAttachment`, backed by
  `GET /internal/connector-attachment/:id` (raw bytes, record in a header — a contract
  is megabytes and base64 in JSON would inflate it for nothing).

  `engine-protocol` gains migration `0004-bound-document` and an optional
  `documentAttachmentId` on `bindDocument`, carried additively onto
  `protocol.content-bound` (with the kernel's own `sha256`), `protocol.signatures-requested`
  and `protocol.signed`. `bindDocument` refuses an attachment that is not on the
  instance being bound — the reconciliation belongs where the document and the hash
  are first named together.

  **Permission diff.** A connection now needs `protocol:read` to send the vertical's
  document. Meridian's `connectScrive` grants it, and also `protocol:attach`, which
  was missing — the sealed-copy landing has been failing there and reporting itself
  as a `skipped` reason rather than an error, so nobody was told.

  **Not a silent fallback.** A named-but-unreadable document is a hard failure. Once
  a vertical has said which bytes its signatory must see, substituting other paper is
  quieter than a refusal and worse, because a document still goes out and someone
  still signs it. The dispatch dead-letters; the ledger row is written only after
  `start`, so the retry after the fix sends the right document.

  `engine-test-kit` gains an opt-in `attachments` option — an engine's declared
  `attachmentTargets` could not be exercised there at all before, because the
  harness's scope had no vertical and so no blob store.

### Patch Changes

- c8f665c: docs: the document store caveat 4 says is missing has shipped — and this connector uses it

  README caveat 4 stated that rendering the real avtal "needs a document store that does not exist
  yet (`attachmentTargets` is declared in the manifest contract and implemented nowhere)". Both
  halves are false. `attachmentTargets` is implemented in `adapter-sqlite` and `adapter-cloudflare`
  — bytes to the per-tenant blob store, metadata in `_substrat_attachments`, permission-gated per
  declared entity type with a spine event in the same transaction (#473) — and
  `reconcileScriveDispatch` in this package has been landing the sealed signed PDF through it since
  #476 step 2.

  So a caveat meant to record a platform gap was telling readers to wait for something they could
  already use, two functions away from code that uses it. The remaining gap is narrower and belongs
  to this connector: `create` calls `renderPdf` unconditionally and has no way to be handed the
  vertical's rendered document. Raised as R4 on #687.

  Docs and one stale source comment only — no behaviour change.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d0a2d0: `ScriveMock` applied the delivery rule to the author, which the real Scrive does not — correcting
  what `0.8.0` claimed about what can start

  `0.8.0` said _"no party carries an address, so the real Scrive refuses every document this
  connector builds"_. Not accurate, and the inaccurate half is the dangerous one. Production started
  a document — Scrive `9222115557586247373`, from the Egeryds scope — and the connector's own ledger
  proves it: `create` has exactly one `putConnectorState` and it sits after `await api.start()`, so a
  ledger row means `start` returned 2xx.

  The error text says which participant it means: _"Invitation delivery for **participant #2**
  requires valid email field."_ Participant #1 is the author, and Scrive never invites the author —
  it is the sending account. So the missing carrier (#687 item 1) splits in two, and only one half is
  loud:

  | party set                     | outcome                                                                              |
  | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | a real counterparty to invite | refused at `start` — visible, retried, journalled                                    |
  | only the author               | **starts, journals a document id, reports `sent for signature`, delivers to nobody** |

  The second row is reachable without anyone choosing it. `requestSignatures` resolves the issuing
  party unconditionally — the declared one, else the **first** — so a caller naming only `counter`
  parties has one of them silently made the issuer, and this connector maps `primary` to
  `is_author`. That is how production got there.

  `ScriveMock.strictDelivery` now exempts the author, because the rule it was applying to every party
  refused the one case that must not be refused and hid the case that actually hurts. Both rows are
  asserted in `test/dispatch.test.ts`: the refusal names participant #2, and the control case asserts
  today's silent start — so closing it is a deliberate edit rather than a test that quietly goes
  green. A `contact` field alone will not close it: an author is uninvitable whatever address it
  carries, so #687 item 1 needs the companion invariant that no document goes out with nobody to
  deliver to.

  No behaviour change in the connector itself; the mock, the README caveat, and the tests are what
  move.

### Minor Changes

- edd764c: `authLevel: 'strong'` dispatches instead of being refused: Scrive's BankID auth-to-sign wants the
  `personal_number` **field**, not a value

  `0.7.0` refused `strong` before egress, reasoning that Scrive requires a personnummer on the party
  and Substrat may carry none (design rule B6). Probed against the testbed (#687): a party carrying
  `personal_number: ''` draws exactly the same `start` errors as one carrying a real personnummer,
  and a party carrying no such field draws `invalid_authentication_to_sign_info` on top of them. So
  `ScriveApi.update` now sends an empty `personal_number` for every `se_bankid` party — the signatory
  completes it during the BankID ceremony — and `scriveAuthMethod` maps `strong` straight through.
  No PII carrier is needed for the auth level.

  Also: a refused `start` reports several reasons at once, and `asJson` surfaced only the first, so
  fixing one problem revealed the next one delivery at a time. All of `error_details.explanations` is
  now joined into the message an operator reads through the delivery-attempt history (#618).

  `ScriveMock` learned the `start` rules the testbed enforces — a `se_bankid` party with no
  `personal_number` field is refused with Scrive's own error envelope — and gained
  `strictDelivery`, which adds the rule the connector still cannot satisfy: **no party carries an
  address**, so every document it builds is refused with `invalid_invitation_delivery_info`, at
  `basic` as much as at `strong`. That is #687 item 1 and this release does not fix it; it is
  asserted in `test/dispatch.test.ts` so it fails loudly when a contact carrier lands.

  `test/live.test.ts` now covers `start` — the call the suite never made, and the only place the
  production 409 ever lived.

### Minor Changes

- 181e69b: fix: the signature request chooses how a party authenticates — `se_bankid` is no longer hardcoded

  Every document `connector-scrive` had ever sent was refused by Scrive:

  ```
  scrive start failed: HTTP 409
  Authentication to sign for participant #1 requires valid personal number field.
  ```

  The connector picked the authentication method from the party's `kind` — `se_bankid` for any
  external signatory — and Scrive's BankID auth-to-sign will not start without a `personal_number`
  on the party. Substrat deliberately supplies none: a party's `ref` is an opaque `DataSubjectId`
  because design rule B6 says a personnummer never reaches the kernel, the events or the audit
  trail. So the connector demanded something the caller could neither see nor satisfy, and a
  production tenant lost a fortnight of contracts to it.

  - **`signatureRequestParty.authLevel`** — `basic` (the provider establishes control of a contact
    address) or `strong` (a national eID), defaulting to `basic`. Deliberately _not_ the provider's
    vocabulary: `se_bankid` is Scrive's word and belongs in the connector that speaks to Scrive,
    or an engine serving several providers would be handing verticals one provider's enum. Stored
    nullable (migration `0003-party-auth-level`) so rows written earlier read as the default, and
    resolved onto `protocol.signatures-requested` so no consumer re-derives it.
  - **`ScriveConnectorOptions.defaultAuthMethod`** — what `basic` means for this connection,
    `'standard'` by default. That default is the fix. A deployment that supplies personal numbers
    by other means can set `'se_bankid'` and keep the old behaviour deliberately.
  - **`strong` is refused before any egress**, with a sentence naming why it cannot be satisfied,
    instead of being sent for Scrive to answer with a bare `409` that reached nobody. The
    resolution happens _before_ `documents/new`, so a refusal leaves no orphan draft at the
    provider — the earlier draft of this fix threw while building the `update` body, and a
    retrying delivery would have littered one document per attempt.

  Callers need no change: a party that says nothing gets `basic`, which is what `standard` already
  meant for principals. **What this does not do** is carry a party's contact detail (ask 1 of the
  issue) — that needs a lawful carrier for direct PII from module code to a connector, which does
  not exist and is tracked separately. Until it does, `strong` is reachable only by a deployment
  supplying personal numbers by other means.

### Patch Changes

- 6ac51d1: docs: every package has a README, and the one on npm stops lying about the initializer

  `create-substrat`'s published README said "The initializer is not released yet. This package
  prints a pointer to the docs and exits. It does not scaffold anything." That has been false
  since the template landed — `index.js` copies the full template tree and generates
  `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.gitignore` and a project README. The
  text on npm was telling readers the entry point to Substrat doesn't work. It also instructed
  `pnpm add … zod`, contradicting the rule the same package's generated `package.json` comment
  states — Zod schemas don't compose across copies, so `z` comes from `@substrat-run/contracts`
  and zod is never installed directly.

  - **Every package now has a README**, including the three that were public on npm without one
    (`vertical-auth`, `oidc-rp`, `psl`) and the monorepo-internal `engine-test-kit` and `ui`.
  - **Every README links substrat.net** — `boundary-lint`, `vertical-host`, `engine-invites` and
    `connector-scrive` each gained the documentation pointer in the shape its README already
    used.
  - **The docs site covers the package list**: new `/reference/vertical-auth`, `/reference/psl`
    and `/reference/create-substrat` pages, all three in the sidebar.

  README-only for the packages listed here; a patch is what carries the corrected text to npm.
  `vertical-host`'s README changed too but is deliberately not bumped — it is in the `fixed`
  group, and a documentation link is not worth a seven-package lockstep release. It ships with
  that group's next version.

### Minor Changes

- 39807d7: feat: connecting an integration means verified, not stored — and every probe names the provider environment it asked

  **The write path was still claiming more than it knew.** Upserting a credential wrote the row and
  reported success; the console said "Connected", which was a statement about our own database. The
  first evidence the provider disagreed arrived on the next dispatch or sweep — after a signature
  request had already failed.

  The relay now checks the candidate credential with the provider _before_ any write:

  - **Refused** (the provider answers 401/403) → `422`, and nothing is stored. The order is the
    whole point on a rotation: writing first would replace a working credential with a broken one.
    The provider's own message rides the response, so the connect dialog keeps what was typed and
    says what is wrong instead of "couldn't save".
  - **Unreachable** (timeout, 5xx, DNS) → stored, reported unverified. Deliberately _not_ a refusal:
    rejecting during a provider outage would make it look like every tenant's keys had gone bad, and
    would block the rotation someone is attempting because things are broken. `ConnectionProbe.refused`
    is what separates a provider speaking about the credential from a provider that did not answer.
  - **Accepted** → stored, and the successful pre-flight is recorded as health, so a just-verified
    connection reads "last used just now" rather than "connected, not used yet" — the same empty
    claim in different words.

  Both write paths get the gate: the dashboard's connect and a vertical's own admin screen through
  `/internal/connections/upsert`. A provider with no candidate probe registered behaves exactly as
  before — the check is available, never assumed.

  `probeScriveSecret` tests a secret that is not stored yet (no connection opened, no health written
  against the live one), and `ScriveApiError` carries the HTTP status so a 401 is _classified_ rather
  than inferred from a message string.

  **Every probe also names the environment it asked.** A production credential sent to Scrive's
  testbed returns 401 — byte-for-byte what a mistyped key returns — so a verify result that does not
  say which Scrive it called sends an operator to check the wrong thing. It is now the first fact on
  both the success and the failure answer: `production (scrive.com)`, `testbed (api-testbed.scrive.com)`,
  or the bare host.

- ee491fc: feat: the Integrations detail actually tells you something — which credential is loaded, and the provider's own archive (not just what we sent)

  Three gaps left by #605's first pass, all found by using the screen:

  **"Manage" opened an empty form.** On the account-level Integrations page, a connected provider's
  primary button still went to the connect dialog with four blank fields — which reads as "your
  credentials are gone". It now opens the detail; rotating is one click further in, where replacing
  a credential belongs.

  **Nothing showed which credential was loaded.** The store's write-only rule is right, but with no
  view at all "connected" and "connected with a mistyped token" looked identical, and the only
  repair on offer was to paste all four fields again blind. `GET /tenants/:t/connections/:id/credential`
  now answers a reduced view, produced by the connector — the only party that knows which of its
  fields are identifiers (Scrive's own UI calls two of the four "credentials identifier") and which
  are secrets. Identifiers come back whole; secrets come back as a bullet run plus their last four
  characters, and anything shorter than eight characters is masked entirely rather than mostly
  revealed. Enough to tell two credentials apart by eye, never enough to sign a request. There is
  still no reveal and no edit-in-place: replacing a credential is rotation.

  **Activity only showed our own dispatches.** The ledger is complete for what this platform sent
  and blind to everything else in the provider account — including documents someone created in
  Scrive's own UI, and anything sent before the connection existed. `GET …/activity?source=provider`
  lists the provider's archive instead, marking which rows came from this app (via the
  `substrat_instance` tag the connector already sets). Neither view is a superset of the other, so
  `source` travels in the answer, and the detail view offers both. Unlike the ledger read, the
  provider read refuses rather than degrading on a provider failure: an empty list would read as
  "the account is empty", which is a lie an operator would act on.

  The honesty banner and page subtitle now say what is actually true about what a console can see.

### Minor Changes

- 92e9e03: feat: an integration becomes something you can interrogate — verify a credential against the provider, and read what the connection has actually done

  Connecting Scrive was a leap of faith. The stored credential was never checked (a typo surfaced
  days later as a failed signing dispatch), and afterwards the only trace of an outbound call was
  health — one line, last-write-wins — because `openConnection` is deliberately unaudited: a row
  per outbound HTTP call would drown the log that matters. Everything else lived in the platform
  worker's logs, which a tenant cannot see.

  Two provider-agnostic reads close that. `POST /tenants/:t/connections/:id/verify` asks the
  provider to accept the credential right now and answers whose account it is; a refused key is a
  `200 { ok: false, error }` carrying the provider's own words, because "this feature is disabled"
  and "invalid credentials" send an operator to different places. `GET …/activity` serves the
  connector's dispatch ledger — the only durable record that a call ever happened — with `?live=1`
  joining the provider's current state, and a `live` flag so a console never presents the platform's
  record as the provider's truth.

  Both dispatch through host-injected `connectionInspectors`, keyed by provider (the `sweepers`
  idiom), so `control-plane-api` still imports no connector and an unwired provider 501s honestly.
  The activity view is the connector's own **projection**, never a raw ledger row: Scrive's rows
  carry the callback capability token, so redaction is structural rather than remembered.

  The Scrive connector gains `getProfile` and `listDocuments` (both verified against the live
  testbed — `/api/v2/getprofile`, not `/api/v2/user/getprofile`), `probeScriveConnection`, and
  `scriveConnectionActivity`. The dashboard's Integrations surfaces get a Details view: health,
  the live grants the connection holds (the readable blast radius), the activity list, and a
  Test connection action. Verifying is itself a use, so it refreshes health too.

### Minor Changes

- 336352b: Webhook ingress (#96) — the push half of the return path, beside the poll floor. A
  dispatch now mints a 256-bit capability token, remembers it on the dispatch ledger
  row, and registers `${base}/hooks/scrive/{connectionId}/{instanceId}/{token}` as the
  document's callback URL (Scrive's callbacks are unauthenticated, so the minted token
  in the URL is the entire authentication). New `handleScriveCallback` verifies a
  presented token in constant time — uniform rejection, zero provider egress without a
  match — and then runs the same idempotent `reconcileScriveDispatch` the sweep runs:
  a callback is a cache invalidation, never a fact, so no body is ever read and replay
  needs no seen-set. `ScriveMock` can now deliver callbacks (`onCallback`), so the
  full sign → callback → record loop runs offline. Breaking for config only: the
  `callbackUrl` option's argument changed from `instanceId: string` to a
  `ScriveCallbackRef` (`{ connectionId, instanceId, token }`); compose it with the new
  `scriveCallbackPath`, and mount `SCRIVE_CALLBACK_ROUTE` where the deployment serves
  HTTP.

### Minor Changes

- b0355b4: `ScriveApi.getMainFile(documentId)` — pull the sealed signed PDF. The connector
  recorded the _fact_ of each signature and walked away from the _artifact_: it
  could create, set file, set parties, start, and get, but had no
  `GET /api/v2/documents/{id}/files/main`, so the signed PDF — Scrive's sealed copy
  with the signing evidence attached — lived only at Scrive, reachable only with the
  API credential. The legacy CRM this vertical replaces fetches that file on
  completion and offers "Ladda ned signerat avtal", so it is parity, not polish
  (issue #476, step 1). `ConnectorResponse` gains `arrayBuffer()` for provider
  responses that are a file rather than JSON (web `Response` already has it; the
  declaration only widens the structural surface). Fetch-on-completion into the
  blob store is step 2, which waits on #473.
- b0355b4: Connectors can land attachments; Scrive lands the sealed signed PDF (#476 step 2).

  #473 gave attachment bytes a home, but its `attachments()` surface is minted per
  `PrincipalId` — and a connector's return path acts as a _connection_, not a person,
  so it had no way to store a provider artifact (bytes cannot ride `getConnectorScope`'s
  `invoke` pipe). This adds the missing seam and the first consumer:

  - **`ScopeHost.getConnectorAttachments(connectionId, scopeId)`** — the mirror of
    `getConnectorScope` for bytes: the same `ScopeAttachments` surface, same
    (tenant, vertical, active) door, but every gate checked against the connection's
    `connection:<id>` grants, and `createdBy` attributed to the connection. Implemented
    in both adapters (the Cloudflare ScopeDO threads the connection subject through the
    attachment gate exactly as `invoke` does) and covered on each.
  - **`engine-protocol`** declares an explicit `protocol:attach` write permission on its
    `protocol` attachment target (read stays `protocol:read`). A signing connection is
    granted `protocol:attach` and nothing else — it can land the sealed PDF but not
    browse the scope's attachments. No human role holds it yet.
  - **`connector-scrive`** fetches `files/main` once the document is `closed` and every
    party is recorded, and lands it as a `customer`-visible attachment on the protocol
    instance. Marked in the dispatch ledger (`sealedAttachmentId`) so a re-poll never
    downloads or stores a second copy; a store that is not yet provisioned is reported
    and retried next poll, never allowed to undo a recorded signature.

### Patch Changes

- 83aa7fd: feat: `definePlatformSweeperDO` — the Cloudflare trigger for `runPlatformSweep` (scheduler.md §3.0, the last blocker on the Scrive poll path, #96)

  A singleton Durable Object whose `alarm()` runs one platform-sweep pass and re-arms itself only
  after the pass settles — the workerd analogue of the kernel's `startPlatformSweeper`, with the
  same non-overlap guarantee (a concurrent kick joins the in-flight pass; the next alarm is a gap
  after settle, never a fixed rate; a pass that sinks whole is reported and the loop re-arms). An
  alarm rather than a cron because a hosted vertical is pushed into a Workers-for-Platforms
  dispatch namespace, where `triggers.crons` is not honoured — the alarm self-arms from code
  (`ensureArmed()`, idempotent) and needs no wrangler config; where a cron IS available, point
  `scheduled()` at `ensureArmed()` as the safety net. Exercised end to end in workerd: a real
  alarm drives the real `runPlatformSweep` against live SCOPE/CONTROL_PLANE Durable Objects.

  The Scrive connector's README now points its "schedule the poll" caveat at both shipped
  triggers (node interval / workerd alarm) and names the one remaining deployment gap: a
  control-plane-less vertical has no connection directory to enumerate, so its sweep waits on
  connections becoming reachable from the vertical's runtime.

### Patch Changes

- 0572a3b: **Typecheck on the native (Go) TypeScript compiler — `typescript` 5.6 → 7.**

  TypeScript 7 (the native compiler, formerly the `tsgo`/`@typescript/native-preview`
  rewrite) is now GA as `typescript@latest`. The binary is still `tsc`, so every package's
  `tsc -p … --noEmit` script is unchanged — only the toolchain pin moves. No source or
  public API changes; this bumps the published packages solely because their build now runs
  through the native compiler.

  Full-workspace `pnpm -r typecheck` drops to ~3s wall; per-package the native checker is
  roughly an order of magnitude faster (kernel 1.33s → 0.07s, control-plane-api 1.50s →
  0.12s, engine-invoicing 0.91s → 0.06s on this machine).

  Two migration deltas TS7's stricter resolution surfaced (both green on 5.6, red on 7):

  - **CSS side-effect imports (`TS2882`).** `import './ui.css'` in the six Vite app/admin
    surfaces now needs an ambient declaration. Fixed the way `demos/meridian/app` already
    did it — `"types": ["vite/client"]` in each app `tsconfig.json` (vite/client declares
    `*.css`) — rather than adding a stray `vite-env.d.ts`.
  - **`boundary-lint` node globals (`TS2584`/`TS2591`).** The linter CLI's `process`,
    `console`, and `node:fs`/`node:path` imports stopped resolving because the base tsconfig
    leaves `types` unset and TS7 no longer implicitly pulls in `@types/node` here. Added an
    explicit `"types": ["node"]` to `packages/boundary-lint/tsconfig.json`.

  Note: TS7 is a major bump that drops deprecated 5.x behavior. Editors should run their
  TS Server on 7 to keep CLI and IDE diagnostics aligned.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 462e8c9: **Publish `@substrat-run/connector-scrive` — the first released version.**

  The connector is no longer `private`. It has been unpublished-while-incomplete since it was
  written; both halves now exist and are tested — outbound dispatch (verified against the real
  `api-testbed.scrive.com`), and the return path that records a completed signature back into the
  scope through the #97 authority seam (`reconcileScriveDispatch` / `sweepScriveReconciliations`,
  driven by `runPlatformSweep`). So it ships.

  Standard publish config, matching the other packages: `publishConfig.access: public`, `files:
["dist"]`. It stays a `0.x` release, which already signals an unstable surface — two honest
  caveats a consumer should know, both documented in the README:

  - **A deployment must schedule the poll.** The connector provides `sweepScriveReconciliations`;
    the consuming vertical calls it on a timer (`startPlatformSweeper` on node, a Cron / DO alarm on
    Cloudflare). Without that, dispatch works but signatures are never recorded back.
  - **The live BankID signing round-trip is unverified.** `se_bankid`-to-sign is disabled on the
    testbed account, so the outbound lifecycle is proven live but the actual signature (and Scrive's
    real signed-`get` party shape) has only been exercised against `ScriveMock`. The reconcile fails
    closed on a shape mismatch, so a wrong assumption cannot mis-record — it skips, visibly.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- e4db6ed: **The Scrive return path — a completed signature now records back into the scope (#97).**

  The connector's outbound half was verified against the testbed; the return path — writing a
  signature onto the protocol instance in the _scope_ — could not be written because a signature
  lives in the scope database, `getScope` demands a `PrincipalId`, and a connector is not one.
  #97 (landed in the kernel/adapters) gave a connection its own door and made its authority an
  ordinary permission grant, so this closes the connector's half:

  ```ts
  reconcileScriveDispatch(host, connectionId, instanceId, { fetch });
  ```

  It reads `documents/{id}/get`, maps each signed provider party back to its request, and records
  it by invoking `protocol/record-signature` through `getConnectorScope` — the connection acting
  as itself. It runs as a **top-level operation, outside any dispatch**, which is exactly what a
  poll driver or callback ingress is, and where re-entering the scope is safe (dispatch
  idempotency stays in the directory for the opposite reason). The connection must hold
  `protocol:record-signature` (`grantToConnection`); without it the write fails closed at the
  permission check, and the grant appears in the permission diff like any other.

  - **Idempotent across polls.** Signed requests are remembered in the dispatch ledger, so a
    re-poll of a half-signed set records only what is newly done, and a fully-signed set records
    nothing. The instance transitions to `signed` only when every party has signed.
  - **Fails closed on a party-order mismatch** rather than attributing a signature to the wrong
    request, and skips a signed party the request named no `ref` for (the connector never
    extracts the signer's personnummer).
  - The dispatch ledger grew the fields the driver needs (`vertical`, `contentHash`, and per-party
    `{requestId, kind, ref}`) — none of it derivable from Scrive's document, so it is captured at
    dispatch when the event still carries it.

  `sweepScriveReconciliations(host, connectionId, { fetch })` is the poll driver over it: it
  enumerates the dispatch ledger (`HostAdmin.listConnectorState`, added alongside) and reconciles
  every outstanding instance — skipping ones the ledger already shows complete, and stepping past a
  provider error on any single instance rather than sinking the batch. Idempotent and scoped to one
  connection.

  Verified against `ScriveMock` advanced to `closed`; the outbound live test still passes. What a
  mock cannot prove — Scrive's real `get` shape and party order — waits on a testbed BankID
  round-trip (BankID-to-sign is disabled on the account).

  **Still not publishable:** nothing calls the sweep on a _timer_ (#96, poll path). No cron, queue
  or Durable Object alarm exists in any deployment — the same trigger `drainDue` still lacks — so
  `sweepScriveReconciliations` runs from a test or by hand. That trigger is a deployment concern,
  not connector code, and is the remaining reason the connector stays unpublished.
