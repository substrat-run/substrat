- f6174fb: The error model, phase 2b: every engine refusal now says what kind of refusal it is.

  All 78 `throw new Error(…)` sites across the seven engines carry a taxonomy code —
  `not_found` for a missing entity, `conflict` for a refused state machine or a broken
  invariant, `validation_failed` for malformed input, and `internal` for the two that mean
  corrupt state rather than a caller mistake (`ledger integrity violated`, `signed protocol
has no primary signature`).

  **Not one message changed.** That is the point, and it is what let 78 sites convert
  without touching a single assertion anywhere else: the demo scenarios, the contract
  suite and every regex-matching transport still see the exact strings they saw before.
  The code rides alongside, for whoever asks.

  Why the engines went first: transports reading `code` only pays off if throws carry one,
  and before this exactly ten did. Every conflict, every not-found and every immutability
  violation in the repo was a bare `Error`, so pointing the transports at `code` would have
  found nothing and left their regex tables permanently un-deletable. Engines are also the
  highest value per edit — their throws ARE the invariants, they are the stable surface
  verticals compose against (D-28), and "the state machine refused" is exactly the class
  message-matching guesses at and frequently misses.

  Each engine also declares its own **conflict reasons** — `BOOKING_CONFLICT_REASONS`,
  `PROTOCOL_CONFLICT_REASONS`, and so on — as an `as const` union, exported alongside a
  matching type. All 45 conflict sites raise one, through a local
  `conflict(reason, message)` helper, so a mistyped slug is a compile error rather than a
  string nothing ever matches:

  ```
  conflict('resource_inactve', …)
  → error TS2345: Argument of type '"resource_inactve"' is not assignable to parameter of
    type '"already_joined" | "already_left" | … | "resource_inactive"'
  ```

  A vertical can now branch on WHY a refusal happened — `immutable_after_export` vs
  `currency_mismatch` — without importing the engine's types or matching on its prose. The
  vocabularies are deliberately coarse: thirteen reasons across protocol's twenty-three
  throw sites, one or two for the smaller engines. They are engine surface, so they evolve
  additively like everything else — new reasons may appear, existing spellings do not
  change.

  Reasons are only on `conflict`. `not_found` declares no extensions and `validation_failed`
  carries field issues instead, so neither has anywhere to put one.

  Still bare, deliberately: the ~30 kernel and adapter throws the control plane's
  `STATUS_PATTERNS` already matches (`already taken`, `illegal scope transition`, `not
active`, `unknown tenant/scope/table`). Those are next, and they are the ones that make
  those regex patterns deletable. The remaining ~237 kernel/adapter throws are genuinely
  `internal` and should stay as they are.

### Minor Changes

- 3b8533d: **zod is now a peer dependency.** Install it alongside these packages:

  ```sh
  npm install zod@^4.4.0
  ```

  Every package here hands out zod schemas that a consumer parses with, composes
  into their own, and that `mountOperations` reads `_zod.def` off to find pinned
  literals. Two copies of zod in one tree means an object made by one is not
  recognised by the other, and the symptom — `expected a Zod schema` — points
  nowhere near the cause. A peer dependency says _use the consumer's copy_.

  The declared range is `^4.4.0` rather than the exact version this repo builds
  against: a peer range should state what the code supports, and pinning it to
  `^4.4.3` would refuse a consumer on 4.4.0 for no reason.

  **A defect this found.** `@substrat-run/contract-tests` shipped **130
  `import("zod")` references in its published `.d.ts` while declaring zod
  nowhere.** It resolved only because contracts had zod as a regular dependency,
  which hoisted a copy into view — not a dependency, a coincidence. It now declares
  it. Two more of the same class turned up when the tree shifted: packages using
  `setTimeout`/`atob`/`btoa` — globals absent from `lib: ES2023` — compiling on an
  ambient `@types/node` nobody had declared.

  That is the general rule now enforced by `pnpm lint:deps`
  (`tools/declared-deps.mjs`) in CI: **every module a package references, in its
  source or its emitted `.d.ts`, must be one it declared.** The `.d.ts` half is the
  sharp one — TypeScript writes the original specifier into declarations however
  the source imported it, so re-exporting `z` through contracts still emits
  `import("zod")` into a dependent's types.

  **Why a lint rather than pnpm's own enforcement**, measured rather than assumed:
  `autoInstallPeers` (pnpm's default) turns a peer conflict into a silent second
  copy — with contracts peer-requiring `^4.4.3` and a consumer declaring `^3.23.0`,
  pnpm reported nothing, and `zod` did not appear once in the peer report even
  under `--strict-peer-dependencies`. And pnpm's peer checking does not reach
  `workspace:` links at all. Full reasoning in `docs/architecture/dependency-policy.md`.

  Internally, shared versions now come from a pnpm `catalog:` so one version is a
  single edit. The `pnpm` settings block moved from `package.json` to
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which is where pnpm 10 reads it — it had been ignored,
  with `overrides` surviving only because they were baked into the lockfile.

  Closes #742.

### Minor Changes

- f4529ed: `engine-metering` v0 (#646): the billable-usage ledger. D-31 deferred metering
  "until a vertical meters something" — the builder token economy is that trigger.
  The engine owns an append-only usage ledger over configured meters (kind/unit
  frozen after creation), idempotent ingest keyed by `(meter, dedupeKey)` (a
  replayed turn can never double-bill; a reused key with a different qty throws),
  the counter/gauge aggregation split (counters sum signed deltas; gauges take
  max-in-window and carry their level across silent windows), and an append-only
  period-close journal whose latest `to` is a hard horizon no new entry may land
  behind — closed periods stay reproducible from their entries forever.

  `closePeriod` emits one fat `metering.period-closed` event with **unpriced**
  lines (`{meterKey, kind, unit, qty, entryCount}`): pricing is vertical
  vocabulary, and the vertical feeds invoicing exactly like the
  `timesheet.period-closed` hand-off. This is the _billable_ metering plane;
  platform metering stays Analytics Engine (D-46 pattern) — two planes, kept
  separate on purpose (`docs/engines/metering.md`).
