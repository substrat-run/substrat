## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- fbf0704: Multi-scope Manyfold: archive a site.

  Rounds out scope management (create + switch were already there) with **archive**, reusing the
  platform-intent mechanism — archiving a scope is a platform action the sandbox-clean vertical can't
  do itself, so it's another intent kind:

  - **contracts:** `archive-scope` kind + `archiveScopePayload` (`{ scopeId }`).
  - **control-plane-api:** `archiveScopeHandler` — the drained scope proves the tenant; the target
    must be under that same tenant and run the same vertical (verified against the directory), then
    `host.admin.archiveScope`. Idempotent (an already-archived/absent target is a no-op success).
  - **control-plane worker:** registers `archive-scope` alongside `provision-sibling` in the drain.
  - **vertical-auth:** `IdentityDO.forgetSite` drops a site from the per-tenant registry.
  - **Manyfold:** a `manyfold/archive-site` op (`content:manage-sites` — no new permission) enqueues
    the intent; `POST /api/sites/:slug/archive` runs it as the caller, then optimistically drops the
    site from the registry so the switcher updates immediately.
  - **Manyfold app:** an admin-only **Archive** control next to the switcher (shown only when the
    tenant has more than one site); it archives the current site and switches away.

  Tested: the handler archives its target + is idempotent + refuses a cross-vertical target;
  `forgetSite` drops a site; the `archive-site` op enqueues an `archive-scope` intent and an author is
  denied. Refs #358.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ad4ccbf: Manyfold multi-scope, M2: a per-tenant site registry so the app lists and switches its sites.

  The per-tenant `IdentityDO` gains a site registry (`recordSite` / `listSites` /
  `resolveSiteScope`, logic factored into `site-registry.ts` so it is unit-testable without a
  Durable Object). Manyfold's worker records each site at `/internal/provision`, serves the
  tenant's sites at `GET /api/sites` (previously 404 in production, which left the switcher
  empty), and resolves the app's `x-site` slug selection to the corresponding scope in `nodeFor`
  — so the existing in-app site switcher now actually switches sites on a deployed install.
  `nodeFor` is split from a sync `baseNode` (the routed tenant + home scope, which the auth
  provider keys on) so the async site resolution never touches the auth path. Tenant isolation is
  unchanged: the registry is per-tenant and `getScope` re-checks the (tenant, scope) pair.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- c64bdf8: Builder-facing recovery for a scope stranded at "roles projected, zero tuples" (#332).

  A CP-less hosted scope could be left with its role definitions projected and
  `permission_source = 'local'` but no principal holding a role — so strict local
  enforcement evaluated against an empty tuple table, every login was denied, and the
  builder who owned the vertical had no lever to fix it (`/internal/provision` is gated by
  the platform's secret, which is correctly never theirs). This closes the hole with a
  prevention and a repair, and never hands a builder `PLATFORM_SECRET`.

  - **Provision is atomic now.** `applyProjection` gains an additive `scopeTuples` argument,
    and `provisionScopeLocal` writes the owner's role grant in the **same** enqueued unit as
    the enforcement flip rather than a follow-up `writeTuple` — so a drop between the two can
    no longer strand a scope. An empty-tuple **guard** refuses to switch on strict local
    enforcement when roles are projected but no live principal→role grant exists (across
    scope- and tenant-level tuples), backstopping every projection path.

  - **The vertical remembers its owner.** `@substrat-run/vertical-auth`'s IdentityDO adds a
    durable `owner_of_record` seat (set at provision, never consumed — unlike `pending_owner`,
    which the first login claims). It lives in the per-tenant IdentityDO, a different DO from
    the scope's data DO, so it survives a scope-DO storage wipe (e.g. a promote, #321).

  - **A builder can trigger the repair.** New `POST /tenants/:tenantId/scopes/:scopeId/provision`
    on the control-plane API — builder-reachable (allowlisted **and** ownership-checked: a
    builder may only reconcile a scope running a vertical its own tenant owns) — re-gathers the
    tenant's entitlements and delegates to the vertical's new `/internal/reconcile`, which
    re-sources the owner from `owner_of_record` and re-runs the idempotent provision. The CP
    holds the platform secret and makes the call on the builder's behalf; a scope with no owner
    of record refuses actionably (409) rather than pretending. Surfaced as
    `substrat scope provision <scopeId>`, authenticated with the builder's existing CP token.

  - **`scope restore` is actionable.** The CLI now surfaces the control plane's `detail` on a
    failed restore instead of collapsing it to a bare message.

  Demo verticals `meridian` and `manyfold` carry the reference `/internal/reconcile` handler.
  Console visibility of provisioning state (roles-only / unprovisioned) is a follow-up.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 2bdd22b: Custom-hostname issuance end-to-end + registrable-suffix (PSL) enforcement (#305).

  Binding a custom domain to a surface is no longer a bare `pending` row that a human flips
  to `active` by hand. The control plane now drives Cloudflare for SaaS through the real
  lifecycle — `pending → verifying → active | failed` — and enforces the registrable-suffix
  isolation D-35 has always specified but never checked in code.

  - **A `CustomHostnameProvisioner` seam** (`packages/control-plane-api/src/custom-hostnames.ts`)
    wraps the Cloudflare `custom_hostnames` API in pure web-standard `fetch`, injected into
    `createControlPlaneApi` exactly like the WfP uploader — so the transport holds no
    Cloudflare credential and the builder never holds one (D-34). Binding a **custom** domain
    calls `create` (→ `verifying`, storing the DNS records the tenant must publish); a
    **platform** mint under `PLATFORM_BASE_DOMAINS` rides the wildcard cert and goes straight
    to `active` with no per-hostname call.

  - **A scheduled reconcile pass** (`reconcilePendingHostnames`, wired into the control-plane
    worker's `scheduled()`) polls every `verifying` domain to `active`/`failed` and retries
    any stuck `pending` custom bind — issuance self-heals without a human. A new
    `POST /hostnames/:hostname/verify` route (and `substrat hostnames verify`, and the
    dashboard's _Check again_) re-polls on demand.

  - **New `@substrat-run/psl`** vendors the Public Suffix List + the canonical matching
    algorithm (no runtime fetch, web-standard only). `resolveCookieDomain` now rejects a
    cookie whose Domain is a public suffix (`co.uk`, `pages.dev`) — a real guard where the old
    label-count check waved multi-level suffixes through — and `bindHostname` refuses a custom
    domain that is a bare public suffix.

  - **Contract + storage.** `hostnameBinding` gains `customHostnameId` and `validationRecords`
    (additively, defaulting to null/[]), plus a `verifying` status and a `dnsRecord` shape. Both
    adapters get the two columns (additive ALTER), a `setHostnameIssuance` writer, and a
    `status` filter on `listHostnames` (index-backed) for the reconcile pass.

  - **The dashboard Domains view is wired to the live control plane** (`/api/domains`): list,
    add a custom domain (shows the DNS records to publish), _Check again_, and remove — no more
    mock rows. Removing a custom domain releases the Cloudflare custom hostname.

  Absent a SaaS zone (dev / self-host), a custom bind records `pending` and issuance simply
  does not run — existing behavior is unchanged until `CF_SAAS_ZONE_ID` is configured.

  - @substrat-run/psl@0.2.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d4bf108: Shared login across a scope's surfaces (K-26 multi-surface): a delivered
  `substrat:auth.cookieDomain` sets the session cookie with `Domain=<parent>` instead of
  host-only, so sibling surfaces (`crm.egeryds.se`, `eka.egeryds.se`, …) share one session.
  The signing secret was already per-tenant (DO-minted), so the attribute is the only thing
  that was missing. Both providers honor it — the OIDC relying party directly, Better Auth
  via `advanced.crossSubDomainCookies` (the worker relays the choice to the IdentityDO as a
  header, re-validated there). `resolveCookieDomain` validates the domain against the
  request host where the cookie is set (equal or proper-suffix at a label boundary, no bare
  TLDs); an invalid domain degrades to host-only rather than breaking sign-in. Setting the
  domain cookie also clears the host-only shadow, and logout clears both variants. Meridian
  threads `cookieDomain` through its `authChoice` as the reference wiring.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0caa0a9]
  - @substrat-run/oidc-rp@0.4.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d93e690: Detachable vertical auth (docs/design/vertical-auth-detach.md): auth moves out of the
  verticals and becomes an install-time choice — a team Auth Server app or any external
  OIDC issuer — with `builtin` (embedded Better Auth) as the unchanged default.

  **auth-server** is now a real multi-instance vertical: one issuer DO per scope behind
  the router (own users, signing secret, JWKS per install), the fixed-name single issuer
  standalone. It implements the K-31 surface (`/internal/provision`, `/internal/configure`)
  and answers unknown `/internal/*` paths with JSON — never the SPA fallback that
  surfaced as "Provisioning failed — internal error".

  **Config delivery seam** (control-plane-api): `VerticalClient.configureInstance` +
  `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/configure` deliver per-instance config to the deployment
  holding the scope's DO (bound-version resolution, 501 when there is nowhere to deliver);
  `ProvisionInstanceInput` gains optional `config` so an app arrives configured
  atomically. The dashboard Env tab now delivers after authoring (`delivered` flag).

  **RP flow** (vertical-auth): `oidcRpAuthProvider` — the full server-side
  Authorization-Code + PKCE relying party as an `AuthProvider`, cookie sessions signed
  with a per-tenant DO-minted secret, bearer fallback for API clients. The IdentityDO
  stores platform-delivered per-scope config and keeps the provider-agnostic
  `sub → principal` directory (TOFU owner claim + invites) under every mode. Meridian
  selects its provider per scope from the delivered `substrat:auth`; its SPA renders a
  redirect sign-in and invite-accept in OIDC mode. jose is bumped to v6 so node JWKS
  fetching goes through `fetch`, matching workerd.

  **Install-time identity** (dashboard): the New-app form's Identity section — builtin,
  a team Auth Server (the app is auto-registered there via RFC 7591 dynamic client
  registration against its real bound hostname), or an external issuer. Wiring failures
  mark the app failed with the reason on its audit trail.

### Patch Changes

  - @substrat-run/oidc-rp@0.3.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 12acc59: **First-run setup state + invite-only sign-up (Phase 1).** A freshly-provisioned instance
  now has an explicit setup state instead of a bare login: the IdentityDO exposes
  `needsSetup(scopeId)` (the owner seat is still unclaimed), and Meridian uses it to

  - serve a **"Set up your workspace — create the admin account"** screen on first visit
    (`/api/me` returns `{ status: 'needs-setup' }` while unclaimed), instead of a plain
    sign-in that gives no hint the first sign-up becomes the admin; and
  - **close open sign-up once the admin has claimed it** — after first-run, a stranger who
    finds the URL can no longer self-register (`/api/auth/sign-up/email` returns 403). The
    window is exactly "owner unclaimed", so it closes the instant the admin is created.

  The claim itself is unchanged (trust-on-first-use — first completed setup wins). The
  member-invite path (how teammates join after setup) is the Phase 2 follow-up.

- fa0707c: **Member invites (Phase 2) — the post-setup join path.** Once a workspace is set up it's
  invite-only; this adds the flow that lets teammates in:

  - **IdentityDO** gains an `invite` directory (token _hash_ only) + `createInvite` /
    `listInvites` / `inviteExists` / `revokeInvite` / `claimInvite`. Claiming binds the
    invitee's subject to a pre-minted member principal.
  - **`CloudflareScopeHost.assignScopeRole(scopeId, principal, roleKey)`** — the member half
    of `provisionScopeLocal`'s owner grant: grant a principal a role at scope level so its
    permissions resolve from the scope's own storage (covered by two new workerd tests).
  - **Meridian**: admin-only `POST/GET /api/invites` (+ `…/revoke`) mint/list invites (role
    granted at creation, one-time accept link returned, plaintext token never stored);
    `POST /api/accept-invite` claims one while signed in; the sign-up gate also opens for a
    valid `?invite=` token. SPA: an admin **Access** tab (invite at a role, copy the link,
    revoke) and an **AcceptInvite** screen driven by `?invite=<token>`.

  Roles a teammate can be invited at are this vertical's roles (hr-admin | manager | payroll);
  employees (HR records) remain separate.

- 6a0e253: **Pluggable, config-selected auth for verticals — a new `@substrat-run/vertical-auth` package, and Meridian on it.**

  Auth is now a config choice behind a small contract, isolated per tenant, with no shared `AUTH_DB`.

  - **`@substrat-run/vertical-auth`** (new): the `AuthProvider` contract (`handle` + `resolve`); an
    OIDC provider (`oidcAuthProvider` — verifies a bearer JWT against the issuer's JWKS, covering
    Supabase, Auth0, AuthHero, Keycloak); and a per-tenant **`IdentityDO`** — Better Auth over
    `drizzle-orm/durable-sqlite` (its own SQLite, one DO per tenant) plus the provider-agnostic
    `sub → principal` directory (`setPendingOwner` / `resolvePrincipal`). Source-exported (`.`,
    `./provider`, `./oidc`).

  - **Meridian** consumes it. The worker picks the provider by config (`AUTH_PROVIDER=better-auth-do`
    default, or `oidc` + `OIDC_ISSUER`/`OIDC_AUDIENCE`); the app never learns which. `/internal/provision`
    seeds the owner seat, and the first login **claims** it (the installer becomes `hr-admin`) —
    provider-agnostically. The shared D1 `AUTH_DB` and its identity directory are gone; `wrangler
--dry-run` shows only the `SCOPE` + `AUTH` (IdentityDO) Durable Objects, so the worker still passes
    the sandbox contract and is pushable to the dispatch namespace.

  Verified on real workerd (Better Auth path): provision → sign-up → invoke claims the owner seat →
  `hr-admin` op succeeds → `/api/me` returns the claimed principal. OIDC verified with jose
  (mint+verify): valid → subject; no token / wrong issuer / expired → null. 21 Meridian node tests pass.

  Follow-ups (see `demos/meridian/DEPLOY.md`): fold the `hr/whoami` shape back into `/api/me` so the
  owner lands on the Admin surface; adopt the package in Callout; remove the now-dead `src/auth.ts` /
  `src/auth-schema.ts`.
