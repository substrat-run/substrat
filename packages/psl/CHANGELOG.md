# @substrat-run/psl

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 733469b: These packages' `test/` directories are now typechecked. Nothing they ship changes — the
  build tsconfig already emitted from `src` alone — but their `typecheck` script now compiles
  the tests too, which caught a `vertical-host` test fixture that had drifted from
  `VerticalScopeHost` and stayed green for months.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- b38cf04: `src/data.ts` now carries the `GENERATED_AT` stamp CLAUDE.md promises for a file generated from a remote source, and its header names the producer script and the list URL. Data unchanged.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 87ec6f2: Every published package now actually ships its license text.

  `LICENSING.md` has always opened by claiming each package "ships the full text in its
  tarball." Eight of them did not: `adapter-cloudflare`, `control-plane-api`,
  `vertical-auth`, `oidc-rp`, `psl`, `boundary-lint`, `model-emit` and `create-substrat`
  declared a license in `package.json` and shipped no `LICENSE` file. npm auto-includes
  `LICENSE*` when present — none was present, so nothing was included.

  That is worth a version bump rather than a docs fix, because a tarball is where the
  claim is either true or false, and `adapter-cloudflare` is the load-bearing case: §5.7
  makes the Cloudflare adapter half of the two-adapter rule that keeps the escrow story
  literally true, and AGPL is what stops a hosted derivative of it from staying closed.
  An AGPL package distributed without its license text is the weakest possible version of
  that. The texts are the stock unmodified AGPL-3.0 and Apache-2.0, byte-identical to the
  copies already in `kernel` and `contracts`.

  No code changes.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6ac51d1: docs: every package has a README, and the one on npm stops lying about the initializer

  `create-substrat`'s published README said "The initializer is not released yet. This package
  prints a pointer to the docs and exits. It does not scaffold anything." That has been false
  since the template landed — `index.js` copies the full template tree and generates
  `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.gitignore` and a project README. The
  text on npm was telling readers the entry point to Substrat doesn't work. It also instructed
  `pnpm add … zod`, contradicting the rule the same package's generated `package.json` comment
  states — Zod schemas don't compose across copies, so `z` comes from `@substrat-run/contracts`
  and zod is never installed directly.

  - **Every package now has a README**, including the three that were public on npm without one
    (`vertical-auth`, `oidc-rp`, `psl`) and the monorepo-internal `engine-test-kit` and `ui`.
  - **Every README links substrat.net** — `boundary-lint`, `vertical-host`, `engine-invites` and
    `connector-scrive` each gained the documentation pointer in the shape its README already
    used.
  - **The docs site covers the package list**: new `/reference/vertical-auth`, `/reference/psl`
    and `/reference/create-substrat` pages, all three in the sidebar.

  README-only for the packages listed here; a patch is what carries the corrected text to npm.
  `vertical-host`'s README changed too but is deliberately not bumped — it is in the `fixed`
  group, and a documentation link is not worth a seven-package lockstep release. It ships with
  that group's next version.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2bdd22b: Custom-hostname issuance end-to-end + registrable-suffix (PSL) enforcement (#305).

  Binding a custom domain to a surface is no longer a bare `pending` row that a human flips
  to `active` by hand. The control plane now drives Cloudflare for SaaS through the real
  lifecycle — `pending → verifying → active | failed` — and enforces the registrable-suffix
  isolation D-35 has always specified but never checked in code.

  - **A `CustomHostnameProvisioner` seam** (`packages/control-plane-api/src/custom-hostnames.ts`)
    wraps the Cloudflare `custom_hostnames` API in pure web-standard `fetch`, injected into
    `createControlPlaneApi` exactly like the WfP uploader — so the transport holds no
    Cloudflare credential and the builder never holds one (D-34). Binding a **custom** domain
    calls `create` (→ `verifying`, storing the DNS records the tenant must publish); a
    **platform** mint under `PLATFORM_BASE_DOMAINS` rides the wildcard cert and goes straight
    to `active` with no per-hostname call.

  - **A scheduled reconcile pass** (`reconcilePendingHostnames`, wired into the control-plane
    worker's `scheduled()`) polls every `verifying` domain to `active`/`failed` and retries
    any stuck `pending` custom bind — issuance self-heals without a human. A new
    `POST /hostnames/:hostname/verify` route (and `substrat hostnames verify`, and the
    dashboard's _Check again_) re-polls on demand.

  - **New `@substrat-run/psl`** vendors the Public Suffix List + the canonical matching
    algorithm (no runtime fetch, web-standard only). `resolveCookieDomain` now rejects a
    cookie whose Domain is a public suffix (`co.uk`, `pages.dev`) — a real guard where the old
    label-count check waved multi-level suffixes through — and `bindHostname` refuses a custom
    domain that is a bare public suffix.

  - **Contract + storage.** `hostnameBinding` gains `customHostnameId` and `validationRecords`
    (additively, defaulting to null/[]), plus a `verifying` status and a `dnsRecord` shape. Both
    adapters get the two columns (additive ALTER), a `setHostnameIssuance` writer, and a
    `status` filter on `listHostnames` (index-backed) for the reconcile pass.

  - **The dashboard Domains view is wired to the live control plane** (`/api/domains`): list,
    add a custom domain (shows the DNS records to publish), _Check again_, and remove — no more
    mock rows. Removing a custom domain releases the Cloudflare custom hostname.

  Absent a SaaS zone (dev / self-host), a custom bind records `pending` and issuance simply
  does not run — existing behavior is unchanged until `CF_SAAS_ZONE_ID` is configured.
