### Minor Changes

- 54d3d0e: Add `@substrat-run/vertical-host` — the platform's `/internal/*` management contract
  (provision, reconcile, introspection, the read-only SQL console, platform-request drain,
  snapshot/delete/export/restore, bookmarks/rewind, configure) plus the guaranteed `{ error }`
  response envelope, authored once and mounted with `mountPlatformSurface(app, deps)`.

  Verticals no longer hand-copy these routes and a Hono `onError` into their own `worker.ts` —
  copies that had already drifted (route sets disagreed; some workers shipped without the error
  handler, so a failing `/internal/restore` reached the control plane as the runtime's bare
  `Internal Server Error` with no diagnosis, issue #510). Meridian, Manyfold and the
  `create-substrat` template now mount the shared surface; a repo-wide `hono` override pins a
  single version so the mounted `Hono` app type matches its consumers.
