- c19e371: fix: a connector failure is readable, and a refused request is no longer retried for two days

  The console's card for a broken Scrive connection said, in full: `Error · scrive · Last error 7m
ago: HTTP 409 from scrive`. The real message was nine words longer and contained the whole
  answer — `Authentication to sign for participant #1 requires valid personal number field`. It
  was journaled correctly by `settlePlatformRequest` and retained; it was simply not reachable
  from anywhere a builder would look. Getting at it meant the read-only SQL console with system
  tables toggled on, or a break-glass `scope pull --full`.

  It cost a production tenant a fortnight. Three signature requests, none of which ever reached a
  counterparty: two `failed` after **100 attempts over two days**, one still `pending` at 78 and
  counting — all on the same permanent client error. The contracts sat in `pending_signature`
  throughout, and the app had nothing to tell the user.

  - **The intent journal is readable.** `_substrat_platform_requests` had one reader,
    `listPlatformRequests`, which returns only `pending` rows — so a _settled_ intent, the only
    kind that holds an answer, was invisible by construction. Its complement,
    `ScopeHost.listPlatformRequestHistory` (`kind` / `status` / `limit`, newest first), is served
    through the vertical's `/internal` surface and the control plane's new
    `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/intents`, and rendered in the dashboard's integration detail as
    "Delivery attempts": id, status, attempts, timings, what was sent, and `lastError`
    **verbatim** — truncating it would rebuild the exact wall the section exists to remove.
  - **A 4xx settles terminal on the first attempt.** `pending` means _try again_, and every throw
    got it by default: right for a provider outage, wrong for a provider's refusal. A 4xx is the
    provider telling the caller its request is wrong; attempt 101 sends the identical bytes.
    `isTerminalProviderError` classifies structurally on the error's `status`, so no host imports
    a connector's error class — and 5xx, 408, 423, 425, 429 and anything with no status stay
    retryable, because a failure you cannot classify must never be settled terminally. Two days of
    silent retries becomes one settled row with the provider's own sentence on it.
  - **A terminal settle is visible to an operator.** It now lands an ops-failure row
    (`stage: 'terminal'`), the same treatment the attempt ceiling already had. A give-up and a
    refusal end the same way — nobody is coming back to the intent — so they deserve the same
    headline.
  - **A vertical can read the outcome of its own intents.** `ctx.platformRequests(filter)` is the
    read half of `ctx.requestPlatform`, which had none: an app could ask the platform to do
    something and then had no supported way to learn whether it happened. This is what lets a
    contract screen say the signing request never left, instead of showing a document that appears
    to be out for signature and is not. Read-only by construction — the kernel owns every write to
    that table.

  `ScopeHost` gained `listPlatformRequestHistory` and `OperationContext` gained
  `platformRequests`; both in-tree adapters implement them and the contract-test suite holds them.
  The 409 itself is a connector/engine gap, filed separately.

### Minor Changes

- 778f48a: Connection grants now reach scopes provisioned after the grant (#592). `grantToConnection` records each grant directory-side alongside the enforcement tuple (`_substrat_connection_grants`, tombstoned by `revokeConnection`'s cascade, readable via `HostAdmin.listConnectionGrants` and `GET /tenants/:tenantId/connection-grants`), and provision/reconcile gather those rows and deliver them per scope — the same authoritative channel as entitlements (#310) and identity links (#406) — so the connector return path works on every install without a human replaying grants, and a revoked connection's grants stop being delivered.

- 1fa4bd0: feat: the connector write-back seam — the platform runs the connector pass for CP-less verticals (#574 phase 1)

  A CP-less dispatch vertical cannot run a connector: the connection directory and
  its sealed secrets live platform-side, and a pushed script must never hold them.
  This lands the approved shape's first phase — the shared control plane runs the
  connector pass FOR dispatch verticals, and the vertical opens one narrow
  write-back door:

  - `vertical-host` mounts three platform-secret-gated verbs:
    `/internal/connector-invoke` (one operation, invoked as the connection),
    `/internal/connector-attachment` (the multipart bytes leg), and
    `/internal/connector-grant` (delivery of the scope-local `connection:<id>`
    grant tuple). Authorization happens in the scope's own DO against that
    delivered tuple — the platform cannot skip the permission check.
  - `CloudflareScopeHost` gains the far-end local methods
    (`connectorInvokeLocal` / `connectorAttachmentUploadLocal` /
    `connectorGrantLocal`) and a `connectorDelegation` option for the platform
    end: with it set, `getConnectorScope().invoke`, `getConnectorAttachments()`
    upload, and scope-level `grantToConnection` ride the delegation to the
    deployment actually serving the scope instead of touching the control plane's
    own module-less scope namespace. Directory gates (live connection,
    tenant/vertical match) still run platform-side before every delegated call.
  - `VerticalClient` speaks the three verbs (`connectorInvoke`,
    `connectorUploadAttachment`, `connectorGrant`).
  - The control plane wires the delegation into its host, seals/opens connection
    credentials with a new `SECRET_BOX_KEY` secret (base64 of 32 bytes, the
    dashboard's exact convention; canonical name `CP_SECRET_BOX_KEY` in
    secrets.mjs), and registers the Scrive sweeper on its scheduled
    `runPlatformSweep` pass — the poll floor now covers hosted verticals'
    connections. `SCRIVE_BASE_URL` selects the provider environment (default:
    testbed).

  Phase 2 (webhook ingress terminating on the platform) and phase 3 (outbound
  dispatch riding platform-requests) follow.

### Patch Changes

- a16a3d4: fix(vertical-host,control-plane): a platform fault answers 502, and the control plane keeps its own logs (#559)

  The `/internal/*` error envelope defaulted every unrecognized throw to 400 — so a
  Cloudflare DO SQLite storage fault (`internal error; reference = <id>`) crossed the
  control plane's verbatim passthrough and reached CI dressed as "you sent a bad
  request", unresolvable by anyone but Cloudflare support and invisible to every
  retry convention that (correctly) refuses to retry a 4xx. The envelope now
  recognizes infrastructure-fault shapes — workerd's `retryable`/`overloaded` flags,
  the redacted DO SQLite message, DO resets — answers 502 with the message intact,
  and logs `vertical-host.platform-fault` structured so the vertical's observability
  keeps stage + reference queryable. App errors that merely mention "internal error"
  mid-sentence stay 400; explicit HTTPException statuses stay authoritative.

  The control-plane worker also gains `observability: enabled` (prod and env.test):
  its own `deploy.upload.failed` / `control-plane.unhandled` diagnostics previously
  existed only in a live `wrangler tail`.

## 0.46.0

### Minor Changes

- 54d3d0e: Add `@substrat-run/vertical-host` — the platform's `/internal/*` management contract
  (provision, reconcile, introspection, the read-only SQL console, platform-request drain,
  snapshot/delete/export/restore, bookmarks/rewind, configure) plus the guaranteed `{ error }`
  response envelope, authored once and mounted with `mountPlatformSurface(app, deps)`.

  Verticals no longer hand-copy these routes and a Hono `onError` into their own `worker.ts` —
  copies that had already drifted (route sets disagreed; some workers shipped without the error
  handler, so a failing `/internal/restore` reached the control plane as the runtime's bare
  `Internal Server Error` with no diagnosis, issue #510). Meridian, Manyfold and the
  `create-substrat` template now mount the shared surface; a repo-wide `hono` override pins a
  single version so the mounted `Hono` app type matches its consumers.
