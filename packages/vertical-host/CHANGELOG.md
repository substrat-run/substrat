- 04c61c1: kernel: the denial log gets a reader (`listDenials`, `summarizeDenials`)

  K-35 shipped the write side in both adapters four weeks ago. Every enforced `assertAllowed`
  denial in production has been recorded since — actor, permission, node, operation, `at` —
  written as a fresh autocommit _after_ the rollback that would otherwise erase the evidence
  of itself. **Nothing read it.** K-35 said so in its own last clause: the directory-side
  surfacing "rides §5.4's admin-query RPC, unbuilt". The only consumer in the repo was a
  contract test (#867).

  That left the platform's three logs two-thirds built and asymmetric: `_substrat_admin_log`
  holds staff mutations and is readable in the console, `_substrat_access_log` (K-24) holds
  staff reads, and `_substrat_denials` (K-35) held refusals for nobody. It is the log that
  matters most of the three, because it is the stronger kind of evidence. A generated
  conformance report says _"we attempted the attack in CI at commit X"_; these rows say _"on
  your data, in production, here is every refusal, by whom, against which key"_.

  **The §5.4 RPC turned out to be built.** This is its first caller in the sense the decision
  meant — two `HostAdmin` reads (`listDenials`, `summarizeDenials`), served as
  `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/denials[/summary]`, reached through the same delegation ladder as
  the table reads: a hosted scope through its vertical's platform-gated `/internal/denials`,
  a co-located one locally. Same `PlatformActorId`, same K-24 access-log entry, same K-3
  `(tenantId, scopeId)` cross-check failing closed on a mismatch. Reading the denial log is
  itself logged. The §7 bound holds unchanged: directory metadata and denial rows, never
  tenant business data.

  **Both of K-35's hedges were built rather than deferred, because both are load-bearing.**

  _Rate-bucketing._ K-35 called it sanctionable up front, and the reason is not tidiness: a
  probing client mints unlimited rows, so a newest-first page of 200 shows 200 rows from one
  prober and hides everyone else — the read fails exactly when it matters. So the bucketed
  view is the default surface, not a refinement, and it is ordered **by count**, which is what
  keeps the quiet actor on the page beside the loud one. Buckets are (actor, permission) —
  K-35's own "first occurrence + count per actor/key/window" — and carry `COUNT(DISTINCT
operation)` beside the count, because one operation refused four hundred times is a broken
  screen or a misconfigured role while the same count across a dozen is someone walking the
  surface.

  _The window is not a retention policy._ Rows drain rather than expire (K-24's split), and
  until a Tier 2 sink exists the window simply **is** the retention. So the summary reports
  the log's oldest and newest held rows computed **ignoring the filter** — a fact about the
  log, not about the query. That is what stops an empty result being read as "this never
  happened" when the truth is "we no longer hold that far back", and an empty log reports a
  null window rather than a fabricated instant.

  Both adapters answer from one shared SQL builder (`kernel/denial-query.ts`), the same shape
  `platform-request-query.ts` uses, so the pure-SQLite host and the Durable Object cannot
  drift on what "newest" means or what a bucket groups by. The filter takes the **logical**
  actor — a bare principal ULID — and normalizes to the stored `JSON.stringify` encoding, so
  no call site has to know how the writer spells it.

  Ten contract-suite tests run against both hosts, including the DO path. Three of them pin
  properties rather than plumbing: that buckets are count-ordered so a flood cannot hide a
  quiet actor, that a window bound narrows `total` and never the window, and that a bare
  `ctx.check` a module branches on writes no denial — K-35's deliberate silence, asserted
  through the read surface an operator actually sees.

  The console renders it per scope, bucketed, with the window stated in the card's own caption.

- 1c1f23c: A read-modify-write says what it is writing over — `concurrency`, `If-Match`, and the 412

  Two people open the same record, both save, and the second write destroys the first. No
  error, no log line, and nobody notices until the data is gone. An operation that is
  read-modify-write now declares what it is writing over:

  ```ts
  'callout/update-facility': {
    input: z.object({ facilityId: z.string(), name: z.string().optional(), … }),
    concurrency: { over: 'facility', idFrom: 'facilityId' },
    emits: { entity: 'facility', entityIdFrom: 'id', type: 'callout.facility-updated', … },
    http: { method: 'PATCH', path: '/facilities/{facilityId}' },
  }
  ```

  One declaration, three consequences. Every response carries the entity's version as an
  `ETag`. An unsafe method compares the caller's `If-Match` against that version **inside the
  operation's transaction** and refuses a stale one with `precondition_failed` (412). The
  generated browser client remembers the tag a read handed back and sends it on the next
  write to that entity, so an app writes no header code.

  No new error vocabulary: `precondition_failed` → 412 has been declared in the taxonomy
  since #113, excluded from `DOCUMENTED_ERROR_CODES` precisely so it would appear when
  something could raise it. It now joins the emitted document **per operation** — on the ones
  that declared `concurrency` and nowhere else.

  **Opt-in, and not left to memory.** Most declared operations are command-shaped:
  `todo/rename-list` takes a name, not a whole entity it read and echoed back, and two
  concurrent renames do not lose an update. But the shape that _does_ lose them is visible in
  the model — one required field naming the row, every other field optional over that
  entity's own columns — and an operation of that shape with no `concurrency` is refused at
  module load, as a bare-array list output with no `paged` already is. It matches nothing in
  the fleet today, which makes now the cheapest moment it will ever be added.

  ### Three things the implementation had to get right

  **A guarded operation must emit.** An entity's version is the ULID of the last event about
  it (#901) — there is no version column. So a guarded write that announces nothing is worse
  than an unguarded one: both writers pass their `If-Match`, neither moves the version, both
  commit, and both receive a 200 with an `ETag` asserting the write was serialised.
  `concurrency.over` is compile-checked against the operation's declared `emits`, which is
  the check `entity-version.ts` asked for by name.

  **The permission answers before the precondition.** The version is snapshotted before the
  handler (its own `emit` moves it) and compared _after_ — because the permission check lives
  inside the handler, and refusing on the version first turns any guarded operation into an
  oracle: a principal with no permission on the entity sends `If-Match: *` and learns whether
  it exists, or sends a tag and learns whether it changed. Found by driving Callout's
  two-tab scenario over real HTTP as a technician, which answered 412 where it owed 403.

  **An unacknowledged precondition is refused, not assumed.** Every previous argument added
  to the coordinator↔ScopeDO RPC was safe for an old DO to ignore — dropping
  `failureEnvelope` makes it throw, which the caller handles. Dropping `ifMatch` would commit
  the write and return 200 with nothing compared. So the DO acknowledges that it evaluated
  the header, and a coordinator that sent one and sees no acknowledgement refuses the success
  rather than reporting a conditional write that was never conditional.

  ### What each package gained

  - **contracts** — `concurrency` on `OperationShape`; `assertConcurrencyMovesVersion` and
    `assertFieldBagsDeclareConcurrency` at module load; `operationConcurrencyOf`;
    `ETAG_HEADER` / `IF_MATCH_HEADER` / `CONCURRENCY_EXPOSED_HEADERS` / `etagOf` /
    `ifMatchAdmits`; `precondition_failed` carries the refused `entity` (and deliberately not
    the current version — handing it back turns the obvious client fix into a blind retry
    that overwrites whatever caused the refusal); the OpenAPI builder emits the header, the
    `ETag` and the 412 per guarded operation.
  - **kernel** — `InvokeOptions` as the third argument to `ScopeStub.invoke`: the
    request-preconditions seam #116 will add `Idempotency-Key` to, plus the reply channel the
    mount reads the tag from. `assertIfMatch`. `ModuleRegistration.operationConcurrency`.
  - **adapter-sqlite / adapter-cloudflare** — the comparison, inside the transaction, in the
    order above; the acknowledgement across the DO hop.
  - **contract-tests** — `concurrencyContractSuite`, 13 cases both adapters pass.
  - **vertical-host** — the mount reads `If-Match` on unsafe methods only (on a `GET` the
    header means a conditional read, and forwarding it would refuse a read for being stale)
    and sets `ETag`.
  - **model-emit** — a guarded method routes through a `guarded()` runtime that keys tags by
    `entityType:id`, evicts on a 412 rather than replacing (auto-retrying with the new tag
    would overwrite the change that caused the refusal), and exposes the map as
    `client.versions`. A client with no guarded operation is byte-identical to before.

  ### Callout adopts it, and adopting it found a bug

  `callout/update-facility` is the fleet's first guarded operation, with
  `callout/get-facility` beside it as the read that hands out the tag — without one, the
  guard is unreachable, since a client could only acquire a tag by writing.

  `callout/create-facility` had never emitted an event. Nothing caught it, because "every
  mutation emits a fat event" is enforced by review rather than by `boundary-lint`. The
  consequence only became visible here: a facility created by a silent write has no version
  at all, so every conditional update against it is refused forever, against a tag the caller
  was never given. It emits `callout.facility-created` now.

  Callout's conformance receipt goes from 1 narrowed check to 3, all driven.

### Minor Changes

- 5b7fbc0: A list read declares its filter and sort vocabulary, and the kernel composes the walk
  behind it (#811, K-41).

  K-18 promised _"engine list APIs accept registry-declared filter/sort predicates with
  correct pagination and counts, the kernel composing the join inside the scope DB"_ and
  nothing implemented it. Twelve reads across four engines and four demos answered with whole
  tables, and `engines/*` carried ~36 hand-written `ORDER BY` clauses, none of them
  caller-selectable — so a vertical wanting a different sort had no path but to fork the
  engine, which is the signal CLAUDE.md names as the engine having drawn its line wrong.

  **`paged` is now a union of two halves, not one shape with optional fields.** Declare `over`
  and the kernel composes the `WHERE`, the `ORDER BY`, the keyset comparison, the `LIMIT` and
  the matching `COUNT` from your entity's declared columns — and provisions the indexes behind
  them, which is the reason this is kernel-layer rather than a query helper in contracts. A
  declared filter with no index is a table scan that passes every test and degrades when one
  tenant's table grows. The columns are compile-checked against the entity registry, and the
  manifest fragment the kernel indexes from is _derived_ from the operations
  (`listsDeclaredBy`), the way emitted events already are.

  ```ts
  paged: {
    over: { entity: 'workorder', sortable: ['number', 'status'], filterable: ['status'] },
    order: 'desc',
  }
  ```

  ```ts
  return mapPage(
    ctx.page<OrderRow>("workorder", { ...input, filters }),
    toWorkOrder
  );
  ```

  The kernel returns rows; the projection and any hydration stay yours. This is not a
  generated-CRUD layer — it invents no routes and no handlers. Adoption also _bounded_ three
  N+1 reads: a hydration that ran once per row in the scope now runs once per row on the page.

  **The other half is not a legacy path.** Five reads cannot be kernel-composed and say so:
  `callout/timeline` walks `_substrat_outbox` (a kernel table, not a registry entity),
  `protocol/list-templates` selects through a correlated `MAX(version)` subquery, and three
  portal reads decide visibility by a per-row proof walk. They declare `sortKey`, own their
  `WHERE`, and still page. `pageVisible` is the helper for the permission-filtered case: it
  over-fetches and advances the cursor by the last row **examined**, so rows the walk rejects
  still move it forward. Its pages may come back short, and a short page does not end the
  walk — only the absent `Link` does.

  **Every kernel-composed walk carries a tie-break.** A keyset over a non-unique column drops
  rows — `status > 'open'` excludes its own ties — so the walk runs over `(sortColumn, id)`
  and the cursor is the `|`-joined composite `pagination.ts` had already pinned with nothing
  producing one. That is also why `over.entity` is pointable-only.

  **The gate.** `defineOperations` refuses at module load an operation whose `output` is a bare
  `z.array(...)` with no `paged`. #811 asked for a `lint:model` gate; a tool has to _find_ the
  declarations, and the ones it would have missed are exactly the four engines this issue was
  filed about. At load it reaches every module, and it immediately found two unbounded reads a
  hand survey had missed.

  **The platform supplies the page.** `mountOperations` parses `limit`/`cursor`/`order`/`sort`
  with the one shared schema and merges them into the input, so the default page size and the
  `LIST_PAGE_MAX` ceiling are true of the surface rather than of the operations whose author
  remembered to restate them. An over-limit request is refused, not silently capped — a caller
  handed 200 of the 100 000 they asked for cannot tell a capped page from the end of a walk.

  **Breaking, in process only** — `minor` rather than `major` because these engines are 0.x,
  where semver puts a breaking change, and because `major` would mint 1.0.0 and claim a
  stability milestone the fleet has not declared. The break is stated here instead.

  `workorder/list`, `invoicing/list`, `protocol/list-templates` and
  `protocol/list-for-entity` now return `Page<T>` instead of `T[]`, and
  `listOrders(ctx, status?)` becomes `listOrders(ctx, page)`. Every call site is a compile
  error, which is how all twelve conversions were found. It is **not** a wire break: #829 moved
  the walk to `Link`/`X-Total-Count` headers, so a paged read's HTTP body is still the entries
  array. `getWorkOrder(ctx, orderId)` is new — added because paging exposed two verticals
  reading every row in the scope to `.find` one.

- 946dd47: A delivery refused before egress stops being captioned as the provider's refusal.

  A `connector:<provider>` dispatch crosses two authorities. On the way to the bytes it calls back
  into the VERTICAL — opening the bound attachment, invoking the return-path operation — and that
  call is checked against the connection's grants. Only once those pass does anything reach the
  provider. Both ends refuse by throwing, both landed in the same `lastError` string, and nothing
  recorded which was which.

  So the drain asked `isTerminalProviderError`, which reads a bare numeric `status` — and every
  `SubstratError` carries one from the problem catalog. A `permission denied: protocol:read` raised
  inside the vertical answered `true`, and the delivery was journaled as _"a client error the
  provider will refuse identically on retry"_. Scrive never received that request. The integration
  drawer then captioned it _"what Scrive said, in full"_, and directly above it rendered the grant
  list that did not contain `protocol:read` — both halves of the diagnosis on one screen, inches
  apart, with nothing saying one was the other's answer. The operator went to audit their Scrive
  account, pressed **Test connection** (which passes, because the credential is fine), and concluded
  the platform was broken.

  ## Terminality and attribution are different questions

  `isTerminalDispatchFailure` decides whether to retry and is deliberately blind to who refused: our
  own `validation_failed` is as final as the provider's 409, and both statuses come from the same
  structural read. `isTerminalProviderError` now answers only "may this be quoted as the provider's
  words", and one of ours never may.

  **No delivery changed its retry behaviour.** That part was never wrong, and moving it would have
  been a silent semantics change smuggled into a bug fix — a permission denial still settles terminal
  on the first attempt rather than burning a hundred drain passes. What changed is what is _said_
  about it.

  ## The attribution is a value, not a sentence

  `PlatformRequestFailure` (`origin`, `code`, `permission`) is journaled beside `lastError` in the
  scope's own spine, so no reader parses prose to learn who refused. `origin: 'unknown'` is a real
  answer — a socket that never opened is not the provider's refusal either — and NULL is a different
  fact again: nobody classified this row, rather than somebody classifying it as unattributable. The
  column is additive and nullable, so an intent settled by an older control plane reads as
  unrecorded rather than acquiring an origin nobody decided.

  ## A `ControlPlaneError` is always ours

  It is constructed in exactly one place — a call _we_ made to the vertical's `/internal` surface came
  back non-2xx — so whatever status it carries is the vertical's answer to the platform, never the
  provider's to us. This is the rule that fixes the reported failure, and it is why the correction
  lands in the control plane alone: a 403 raised by a deployment that predates this change is still
  attributed correctly, with no vertical redeploy in the path.

  The permission key is read from the structured field when it survived the hop, and recovered from
  the kernel-authored `permission denied: <key>` message when it did not — applied ONLY to a failure
  already attributed to us, so a provider echoing the phrase can never be re-read as our own refusal.
  Nothing parses prose to decide the origin.

  ## The drawer joins what it was already rendering

  A failed delivery naming a permission absent from the connection's live grants now says so where
  the failure is. When the key IS held the sentence is deliberately not written — that is a different
  bug, and guessing at it would rebuild the wall this removes. The panel-level caption no longer
  claims the provider's voice for deliveries it cannot attribute; it says less instead of guessing.

  **Permission diff:** none. No permission key, role or grant changes.

  **Migration diff:** one nullable spine column (`_substrat_platform_requests.last_failure`), added by
  the same attempt-and-tolerate `ALTER` both adapters already use for `authorization` and
  `revoked_at`. No module migration. The pending-intent read in both adapters also adopts
  `PLATFORM_REQUEST_COLUMNS`, which it had duplicated — that duplication is what the constant exists
  to prevent, and it drifted the moment a column was added.

  Closes #841 steps 1 and 2. Step 3 was declined with #726 (the repair is a reconcile, not a button)
  and step 4 shipped there as `lint:connector-grants`.

### Minor Changes

- ca3377d: A connection's grants become readable, and a connector's per-dispatch read stops being a standing one.

  Every other authority in this model is inspectable from where a vertical sits: the permission
  surface is diffed at promote, role tuples are readable from the scope, entitlements and identity
  links are projected and read back locally. A connection's grants were the exception — write-only
  from the deployment, readable only with staff access to the control plane — and they are the
  authority behind the one actor that is not a person.

  That blind spot has a cost on the record. `protocol:attach` was missing from a live Scrive
  connection for months, failing the sealed-copy landing into a `skipped` reason nobody reads, on
  a path whose whole purpose is to bring a legal signature home. It was found by a human reading a
  diff on an unrelated PR (#716). There was no read that could have surfaced it and no alarm that
  would have.

  ## The read

  `ScopeHost.connectionGrantsInScope(tenantId, scopeId)` answers from the scope's **own delivered
  tuples** — the rows the permission checker itself walks — so what it returns is what would
  actually be enforced there, including a scope whose delivery is behind the directory. The
  directory's view is a different fact and stays on `HostAdmin`. `conn.grants()` narrows it to one
  connection inside a dispatch, so a connector can assert its preconditions at the top of a
  delivery instead of meeting a missing grant as a refusal several calls later.

  Both tuple stores are read, and getting that wrong was the near-miss. A scope check consults
  tenant-level tuples too (rule-2 inheritance), and the two adapters split them differently: the
  pure adapter keeps tenant-wide grants in the directory, while a Cloudflare scope holds _projected_
  tenant tuples in its DO and _live_ ones in the control plane. Reading only the scope's own table
  reports a tenant-wide grant absent while it is being enforced — a read-back that disagrees with
  the checker is worse than none, because it is the read an operator would believe. The contract
  suite pins the agreement against real evaluation via the probe operation, not against the rows
  the query happened to select.

  ## The per-dispatch capability (#726 remedy B)

  The check site is entity-aware and the grant site is not. `attachments.open` asks
  `ctx.check(gate.read, { entityType, entityId })`; `connectionGrant.node` is `{ tenantId, scopeId }`
  with no entity leg, so a connection could only ever hold a permission scope-wide. The narrow
  question was being answered by the one model that could not answer it narrowly.

  And the read a signing connector makes is per-dispatch by nature. The event names one
  `documentAttachmentId`; `bindDocument` already refuses to bind an attachment owned by anything
  but the instance being signed; `openAttachment` takes an id rather than a search. So the
  authority becomes the delivery:

  > A connector dispatch may open attachments owned by the entity the delivered event names.

  Nothing new had to be invented to carry it — both facts were already kernel-stamped, and both
  adapters already tracked the delivery as ambient dispatch state (`causedBy`). The entity is
  **derived, never asserted by the caller**: what crosses the hosted `/internal` seam is an event
  id the serving deployment resolves against its own outbox. The platform runs the connector and
  can name any delivery; it cannot name an entity.

  There is no fallback to the permission check, on either a mismatch or an unresolvable id.
  "We could not resolve the delivery, so check the grant instead" is how a narrowing becomes a
  no-op — and a grant would re-widen exactly what this narrows, since `protocol:read` is not a
  keyhole: it also gates `protocol/get`, `list-templates` and `list-for-entity`, none of which a
  connector sending one named document reaches.

  `protocol:read` accordingly leaves the dashboard's Scrive catalog. There is no grant to hold, so
  there is none to miss.

  ## The declaration, and the gate that makes it load-bearing

  Three lists described one fact and nothing checked that they agreed: the connector declared what
  it needed in prose, the dashboard's catalog hardcoded what it would grant, and a vertical passed
  a third list with its own upsert. They did disagree — the catalog still read
  `['protocol:record-signature', 'protocol:attach']` after connector-scrive 0.9.0 shipped needing
  more, so no tenant connecting through the dashboard could be granted what the connector
  required, and that surfaced as an avtal failing to reach Scrive (#841).

  `SCRIVE_CONNECTION_GRANTS` puts the requirement where the knowledge is. `pnpm
lint:connector-grants` (new CI step) fails when no dashboard door can carry one. Standing grants
  only, deliberately: per-dispatch reads are authorized by the delivery now, so they belong in
  neither list; what remains is the return path, which runs top-level with no delivered event
  behind it. It checks a floor rather than an equality, so tightening a connector's needs never
  reds the repo on a stale extra.

  ## What did NOT get built, and why

  No grant-only write route — a button adding a missing grant without re-submitting a working
  credential. It is declined and recorded in `connections.md` §3.5.2: it would hand-patch drift a
  declaration should prevent, put the repair in a console nobody diffs, and ask a tenant to decide
  something that is the vertical's requirement rather than their choice. §3.5.1's law then holds by
  construction — there is no act to launder if there is no act.

  What replaces it is **not in this change**, and the doc says so rather than implying otherwise.
  The right repair is reconcile-to-target — compute the grant set from the declaration, then grant
  and revoke directory rows to match, exactly as `setEntitlementsHandler` already does for a managed
  tenant's entitlements — after which a missing grant is fixed by a push. Today the reconcile only
  delivers grants that ALREADY exist as directory rows (`listConnectionGrants`); it creates none. So
  an existing connection missing a standing grant is now _visible_ and still repairable only through
  the credential upsert. Closed here: the per-dispatch read needs no grant at all, a NEW connection
  gets what the connector declares, and a declaration no door can carry is a red.

  ## Three tests changed behaviour rather than breaking

  That change is the substance, so each was rewritten to pin the new rule from both sides rather
  than deleted:

  - The connector sends the bound document **holding no read grant at all** — and refuses an
    attachment the delivery does not name **while holding the key**.
  - The invariant those tests were really protecting — send NOTHING rather than the wrong paper —
    moves onto the failure that can still happen: a binding whose bytes are gone still
    dead-letters rather than substituting the attestation sheet.
  - The `/internal` seam test now asserts the delivery is carried through, because a dropped
    `eventId` would silently fall back to the grant check — which looks like it works, right up
    until the grant is the one that was removed.

## 0.82.0

### Minor Changes

- 31ab573: A page's walk moves to response headers, so adopting paging breaks no client (#829).

  `paged` (#811 / #823) wrapped a list read's response body: `[…]` — or a vertical's own
  `{ customers: […] }` — became `{ entries: […], nextCursor }`. That renames a live
  endpoint's contract, and a vertical publishing a REST API has no way to soften it: no
  "serve both for one release", no version to hang a transition on, nothing in the emitted
  document marking the change as breaking. So the rational move for anyone with API
  consumers was **not to adopt**, which is the opposite of what an unbounded list read
  deserves — and for the list reads whose published shape was a bare array it could not be
  softened at all, because a body cannot be an array and an object at once.

  The body is now the entries, and the walk rides in headers:

  ```http
  GET /api/customers?limit=20&status=active

  200 OK
  Link: <https://api…/customers?limit=20&status=active&cursor=01J9A…>; rel="next"
  X-Total-Count: 340

  [ … ]
  ```

  `Link` is RFC 8288 — the header GitHub serves — and it hands the client a URL to **follow**
  rather than one to assemble, so the filters and page size travel with it. Its absence is
  how a walk ends. Deliberately not `Content-Range: items 0-19/340`: that describes an offset
  window, and keyset paging does not know its offset — that ignorance is what keeps it
  correct while rows are being written, so a start index would be a number we invented.

  **Inside the platform a page is still a value.** `stub.invoke` returns `Page<T>` exactly as
  before — an operation is transport-agnostic, and a test, a seed or another operation has no
  HTTP response to read a header off. This is a projection at the wire, applied by
  `mountOperations`; handlers, `pageOf`/`countedPageOf` and the `paged` declaration are all
  unchanged. A vertical supplying its own `respond` receives the whole `Page` and keeps
  deciding its own body.

  New in `@substrat-run/contracts`: `nextPageLink`, `isPage`, `PAGE_LINK_HEADER`,
  `PAGE_TOTAL_HEADER`, `PAGE_EXPOSED_HEADERS`. The emitted OpenAPI documents the response as
  an array of the declared entry plus both headers, so the walk is discoverable where a
  client generator looks.

  **One caveat this choice creates:** a browser client on a different origin cannot read
  `Link` or `X-Total-Count` unless the server lists them in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` —
  and the symptom is not an error, it is a list that appears to have one page.
  `PAGE_EXPOSED_HEADERS` is the list to expose. Nothing in the platform sets CORS today.

  This changes a wire format shipped days ago in #823, whose adopters are `demos/todo` and
  one production vertical. The platform's own control-plane API keeps the body envelope: its
  consumers are the console and dashboard, versioned and deployed with it, so it has no
  unknown client to protect.

- 83b0ca3: Paged reads become a declaration the compiler and the document both understand (#811).

  The keyset pagination convention has existed in `contracts/pagination.ts` since the admin
  log — `?limit&cursor&order` in, `{ entries, nextCursor }` out, keyset never offset — and
  was adopted across the control plane, dashboard and console. Engines and verticals never
  adopted it, so their list reads still return whole tables. This is the seam that lets them.

  An operation declares `paged`, and `output` then carries the **entry** shape:

  ```ts
  'todo/list-items': {
    permission: { key: 'list:contribute', entity: 'list', idFrom: 'listId' },
    input: z.object({ listId: z.string(), limit: …, cursor: … }),
    output: todoEntities.item.fields,   // the ENTRY, not the envelope
    paged: { sortKey: 'id' },
    http: { method: 'GET', path: '/lists/{listId}/items' },
  }
  ```

  - `sortKey` is a **compile-checked join** onto the output's own fields, the same idiom as
    `entityIdFrom` and for the same reason: a cursor over a field the entry does not have is
    a page that silently skips or repeats rows, and nothing downstream would flag it.
  - `HandlerOutput` derives `Page<Entry>` for the handler, so declaring `paged` and
    returning a bare array does not compile. That derivation lives in contracts rather than
    in each vertical's `satisfies` clause — one place to be right about the envelope.
  - The emitted OpenAPI grows `limit` / `cursor` / `order` query parameters and the
    `{ entries, nextCursor }` response schema, built with the same `pageSchema` the handler
    is typed against, so document and code cannot disagree.

  A **total count is opt-in**, because you cannot get one from a keyset page for free and
  business software asks for it constantly:

  ```ts
  paged: { sortKey: 'id', total: true },
  ```

  The handler then returns `countedPageOf` instead of `pageOf`, and the compiler holds it to
  that — swapping one for the other is a type error, not a missing field discovered in the
  UI. The number counts the **filtered** set, the same `WHERE` the page ran under: counting
  the table instead is the mistake that looks right until a second list exists, so there is a
  test for exactly that.

  `todo/list-items` adopts it end to end — declaration, keyset SQL, route, artifact — as the
  worked example the next vertical copies. Its `ORDER BY created_at, id` collapses to
  `ORDER BY id`: a ULID is creation-ordered, so that is the same sequence with one fewer
  column, and a cursor can name it.

  Tested where it can actually break. The scenario suite walks a five-row list two at a time
  and asserts every row exactly once with no trailing empty request, then adds a row
  _between_ two pages and proves the next page does not repeat one — the property an offset
  cannot promise on a table being written to. And because scenario suites invoke operations
  directly and never touch the HTTP layer, `vertical-host` drives `?limit=2&cursor=…` through
  a real Hono app to prove the query string arrives coerced to a number rather than as
  `'2'`.

  Nothing else changes: no other operation declares `paged`, so no other list read moves.
  The remaining adoptions, and the lint that fails an undeclared `z.array()` output, follow.

### Minor Changes

- bb32545: The error model, phase 2: the kernel's errors join the taxonomy — and the RPC hop turns
  out not to carry them.

  `PermissionDenied` and `SecretBoxUnconfiguredError` are now `SubstratError` subclasses,
  so a transport can ask what a throw IS instead of knowing which classes exist. Both keep
  their exact names and messages: `vertical-host`'s classifier and several verticals match
  those strings today, and renaming them would be a behaviour change smuggled into a
  refactor. `errorCodeOf` reads a code by shape — the live property first, then the name,
  then the legacy class names — and `vertical-host`'s `classifyError` consults it before
  falling through to its message patterns.

  **The part worth reading.** Phase 2 was written expecting to make the taxonomy survive
  the ScopeDO boundary. It does not, and the RFC's §3 has been rewritten because the
  measurement contradicts it.

  Workers RPC carries a thrown error's **message and nothing else**. `name` is not a second
  channel: setting it does not deliver a `name` on the far side — workerd folds it into the
  message as `"<name>: <message>"` and resets `name` to `'Error'`. That was implemented,
  and the new test caught it: adopting it would have rewritten every error message on the
  Cloudflare path, turning `permission denied: perm:use` into `PermissionDenied: permission
denied: perm:use` for every log line, vertical `onError` and UI string. It was reverted.

  The measurement is now a test in `adapter-cloudflare`, pinning both halves: that messages
  cross verbatim, and that no class, name or code crosses with them. Every other error test
  in the repo runs in a single isolate, where the class survives and `instanceof` works —
  which is exactly why the production bug (`instanceof PermissionDenied` false on
  Cloudflare) stayed invisible for so long. Nothing crossed the hop in a test until now.

  So the RFC's contingency is promoted to the plan: structure crossing that boundary has to
  travel as a **value** — a discriminated `{ ok, error }` envelope on `ScopeDO.invoke` —
  not as a throw. That is its own change and its own review.

  What holds today: in-process, the real class arrives and the full taxonomy works — the
  SQLite adapter, and any handler in the same isolate as its scope. On Cloudflare a
  transport still classifies by message, exactly as before: no better, and no worse.

### Minor Changes

- e3c3e2b: `mountOperations` answers a refused permission with 403, and hands the vertical
  the seam it was missing.

  Every failure the derived mount could produce came back as `500 Internal Server
Error`. A permission denial — the most common non-success outcome in a
  permissioned system, and one the kernel raises as a typed `PermissionDenied` —
  was indistinguishable from a crash, and so was an input that failed to parse
  (#791). Only the success case was right.

  The failure is worse than a wrong number: a client that reads `ok` off every
  reply cannot find it on a raw result at 200 either, so it falls back to
  `res.ok` — true — and renders empty screens successfully, on every endpoint, with
  no error anywhere.

  **The kernel's own vocabulary is now mapped, and nothing else is.** A refused
  permission is 403, a `ZodError` is 400, a body that is not JSON is 400, an
  `HTTPException` keeps the status it already chose (so `resolveStub` refusing an
  anonymous call is still 401), and a Durable Object / runtime fault is 502 (#559).
  Anything else is **re-thrown untouched**, so a vertical's own `app.onError` still
  receives its own domain errors exactly as before and keeps mapping them.

  What is mapped is re-thrown as an `HTTPException`, not answered directly: this
  decides the _status_, and an app that owns an error envelope goes on owning the
  _body_. `mountPlatformSurface`'s handler already reads the status and wraps the
  message, so a worker mounting both surfaces gets one envelope at the right code.

  **Two new options for a vertical that wants the shape too.** `respond(c, result,
operation)` decides the success response — the mount had already decided that
  much while leaving failures to the vertical, so an adopting vertical's envelope
  ended up defined in two places in two vocabularies. It is also the honest home
  for per-request work between the invoke and the response (stripping a field the
  caller may not see, relaying a credential, sending mail); the alternative
  verticals were reaching for is a `resolveStub` whose `invoke` returns an envelope
  instead of the operation's result, which makes `ScopeStub` a lie. `onError(c,
error, operation)` decides the failure response, and may return `undefined` to
  fall through to the mapping above.

  Both are optional and both default to today's behaviour, so the only change to an
  existing mount is that statuses stopped lying.

  The classification itself moved into one module shared with
  `mountPlatformSurface`, which has answered the same question since #510 — two
  surfaces on the same worker disagreeing about the same kernel errors was one
  vocabulary too many. It is exported as `classifyError` for a vertical that wants
  to reuse it in a handler of its own.

### Minor Changes

- 20818ce: `mountOperations` types the values a URL carries, and refuses a route that can
  never be reached.

  Two things a hand-written route table did for free, found by a vertical with 195
  declared routes that could not switch to the derived mount without them (#785).

  **A query string carries no types.** `?limit=100` arrived as the string `'100'`,
  so an operation declaring `limit: z.number().int().optional()` rejected its own
  endpoint with "expected number, received string". That is the most common read
  shape there is — 29 of that vertical's 81 reads carry a paging `limit` — and the
  mount, not the model, is where the fix belongs. Declaring `z.coerce.number()`
  instead would make the transport's problem true everywhere else too: for the
  JSON body, for a direct `stub.invoke`, and for every test. `input` is the same
  Zod object the handler parses, and it has to stay transport-agnostic to be worth
  anything.

  So the mount reads the declared shape and coerces the fields whose declared type
  cannot be a string — `number`, `boolean`, `bigint`, looked through `optional`,
  `nullable`, `default`, `catch` and a pipe's input side. Path parameters get the
  same treatment, since `/pages/{page}` had the identical problem. Chosen over
  coercing by JSON grammar, which cannot tell `?q=123` the search term from
  `?q=123` the number without an encoding convention every caller has to honour.
  A value the declared type cannot accept passes through unchanged, so the error
  still names what the caller actually sent rather than "received nan".

  **Registration order decided routing by operation name.** Hono dispatches in
  registration order, and this registered in alphabetical order of the operation
  name — a name with no relationship to routing precedence. `support/get` sorts
  before `support/list-mine`, so a live `GET /support/issues/mine` disappeared
  behind `GET /support/issues/{id}`: no error, no warning, just an endpoint that
  silently belonged to its neighbour.

  Routes are now ordered by path specificity, segment by segment, static before
  parameter. That is not a house rule — it is the precedence OpenAPI already
  writes down for exactly this case, and it keeps a reserved word in an id slot
  working without renaming a live URL.

  What ordering cannot resolve now fails loudly: two operations that dispatch
  identically (same method, same path shape, different parameter names) throw at
  mount naming both, because there is no reading under which both are live.

- f8bf35e: `http.method` accepts `PUT` (#777).

  The union was `GET | POST | PATCH | DELETE`, with no comment defending the exclusion and no
  semantic argument recorded for it — the demos that shaped it happened not to use `PUT`. A
  vertical with live `PUT` routes therefore could not declare them, and its choice was to break
  25 production URLs by redeclaring them `PATCH`, or to keep the hand-written route table that
  `mountOperations` exists to delete. Neither is a trade an enum omission should force.

  Widened at all four sites — the operation shape, the engine route bindings, the OpenAPI
  catalog, and the host's route derivation — plus the two branches that read the method:
  `PUT` carries a body like `POST`/`PATCH`, and `mountOperations` now dispatches it to
  `app.put`. Purely additive: widening an accepted union breaks no existing declaration, and a
  vertical that does not use `PUT` sees no change.

### Minor Changes

- f869541: Engine route binding, and an API document derived from the model.

  **`defineEngineRoutes`** — a vertical declares where a composed engine's
  operations live in its own API. An engine declares no `http` and should not: it
  is entity-agnostic and does not own a URL shape, since a bike shop calls the same
  work order a repair. That left a composing vertical hand-writing most of its
  route table — 17 of Callout's 27 routes. Every `{var}` is checked against the
  engine's input schema, so a path naming a field the engine does not accept is a
  compile error rather than a silent 400.

  The operation NAME cannot be checked at compile time: `ModuleRegistration` types
  its operations as `Record<string, OperationHandler>`, erasing the keys before a
  vertical can see them. `mountOperations` gains `knownOperations`, so a typo fails
  at mount with a message naming it instead of as a 404 the first time somebody
  calls that endpoint.

  **`apiCatalogFrom`** — the OpenAPI catalog, read off the declared operations
  rather than restated. Meridian's hand-written catalog is 226 lines and
  Manyfold's 184, all of it repeating what the model already says. `tag` and
  `description` stay supplied, the same prose/derived split as
  `manifestOperations`.

  **`ApiOperationDoc.http`** — the document now describes the route the server
  actually serves. Before operations declared `http`, the only shape available was
  the platform's `/api/op/{name}` invoke convention, so a vertical serving REST
  routes published a document describing a surface it did not have. Path
  parameters are emitted as OpenAPI `parameters`, and several operations sharing a
  URL merge into one path item. Verticals whose catalogs declare no `http` are
  byte-identical to before.

- f869541: `narrows` names the permission keys its walk checks.

  An operation that proves access per entity declared only a `reason`, so a key
  reached **solely** by a proof walk contributed nothing to the derived permission
  surface — and would have been absent from the review artifact that exists to make
  a widened permission impossible to miss.

  `narrows` now carries `checks: readonly PermKey[]` alongside `reason`, and
  `permissionsUsedBy` gathers those keys as well as the leading `permission` ones.
  Empty is a legitimate, explicit answer: Callout's portal walk evaluates only
  `workorder:read`, which the workorder engine declares — a vertical restating
  another module's permissions is the same two-descriptions defect this prevents.

  Also adds `manifestOperations(operations, { permissions })`, the operation-side
  counterpart to `manifestEntities`: the manifest's `permissions` list and
  `events.emits` are derived from what the operations declare, with descriptions
  supplied beside the manifest and checked for exhaustiveness. A key an operation
  checks that nobody described is an error rather than an undocumented permission.

  **Migrating:** add `checks` to every `narrows` declaration — the vertical's own
  keys the walk evaluates, or `[]`.

  `@substrat-run/vertical-host` gains `mountOperations(app, operations, resolveStub)`,
  which derives the Hono route table from the operations' own `http` declarations —
  method, path, and which input fields the path carries are already declared and
  compile-checked, so writing them again by hand is a second description that
  drifts. A runtime derivation rather than a generator: the model is TypeScript, so
  `operations` is a live object and there is nothing to emit or regenerate.

  It found real drift on first contact. Callout declared `callout/price-list` at
  `/price-list` while serving — and its web client calling — `/prices`. Three
  descriptions, one wrong, and nothing could contradict it until the route table
  was derived from the declaration. The declaration is corrected here.

  Scope: a vertical's OWN operations. A composed engine's operations carry no
  `http`, because the engine does not own a URL shape — the vertical mounts those
  itself.

- 9208b4e: A signature request can carry **how a party is reached** — sealed to the
  connector, never readable in the spine (#687 item 1,
  `docs/architecture/signature-contact-carrier.md`).

  Every external signature this platform has ever sent has failed. The reason was
  not the auth level and never was: `connector-scrive` mapped each party to a role
  label — "Beställare" — and no address, so Scrive answered
  `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` and a document started with nobody to deliver
  it to. `ScriveParty.email` was declared, wired into the provider's `fields`
  array, and filled by nothing. This is its producer.

  **Why it took a design.** The obvious carrier — put the address on the event —
  is unavailable: `protocol.signatures-requested` lands in `_substrat_outbox` and
  `_substrat_platform_requests`, kernel rows a vertical may neither write nor
  erase, so anything a hosted vertical emits in plaintext stays plaintext in copies
  it cannot reach. The next obvious one — seal it under the per-subject keys — is
  impossible rather than merely awkward: those keys live in the directory, and a
  sandbox-clean vertical is architecturally on the far side of that boundary
  (§2 of the design derives it). And reading the contact back at egress deadlocks,
  because a connector runs _inside_ the scope's dispatch and re-entering the scope
  actor wedges it.

  What works is the gap in the middle: a scope may never hold a _secret_ key, and
  nothing says that about a _public_ one.

  - **`sealTo` / `openSealed` in the kernel** — the asymmetric sibling of
    `SecretBox`: ECDH P-256 → AES-256-GCM, a fresh ephemeral keypair per seal, and
    an envelope that is a `SealedSecret` so it carries `keyId`. A cell that cannot
    name its key can only ever have one, and every ciphertext already written
    becomes ambiguous the day a second exists. Rotation is deferred; the envelope
    that permits it is not.
  - **A keypair per connection.** The private half is sealed under the host
    `SecretBox` beside the credential and stored **keyId-indexed from day one**,
    even holding one member — widening a column into a set later is a migration
    against live connections. Minted on first ask, so a connection older than this
    feature acquires one by being asked rather than by being reconnected.
  - **The public half is projected into the scope**, on the channel that already
    carries entitlements, identity links and connection grants — not
    `configureInstance`, because a key in the config bag becomes a key in a
    settings form.
  - **`ctx.sealToConnection(provider, plaintext)`** — awaited _before_ `ctx.emit`,
    so `emit` stays synchronous and D-28 is untouched. **Fails closed and legibly**
    when no key has reached the scope: emitting a request with its addresses
    silently dropped is the invisible failure this exists to end.
  - **`conn.unseal(cell)`** at egress, on the connection for the same reason
    `fetch` and `openAttachment` are — key material never crosses into connector
    code.

  `engine-protocol` gains `partyContact { email?, mobile? }` on
  `signatureRequestParty` and migration `0005-party-contact`, which stores **only
  the ciphertext**. There is no plaintext column to clear later and no erasure
  story to write: the address is unreadable to the spine, to its backups and to
  `sealDump`'s output, because the key that opens it is in the directory.
  `piiClass` therefore stays `'none'` — see the migration's own note for why
  `'pseudonymous'` would be actively wrong rather than more honest.

  **No `personalNumber` field, and its absence is the decision.** #687 measured the
  premise and it is false: what a provider validates is that a BankID party _has_
  the field, not that it holds a value. An optional PII field on an engine surface
  is a carrier that exists.

  Two invariants ship with the carrier, both in `requestSignatures`, both refusing
  before anything freezes:

  - **A party that will be invited must be reachable.** Otherwise the provider
    refuses after the instance has already frozen, leaving an avtal that looks sent
    for signature and is not.
  - **A set with no counterparty is refused.** "The declared primary, else the
    FIRST" is a total function, so a one-party request never failed here — it
    failed at the provider, where that party had been made the _author_, and an
    author is never invited. In production that party was the customer.

  Verified against the Scrive **testbed**, not only the mock: a party carrying an
  address no longer draws `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` at either auth level,
  and a document with one starts and reaches `pending`. The connector tolerates an
  absent contact in both skew directions — an older engine sends none, an older
  connector strips the field — so neither combination is worse than today, which is
  that nothing works.

### Minor Changes

- 4eb532b: The signatory is sent the contract, not an attestation sheet (#711).

  `connector-scrive`'s `create` rendered its own document unconditionally: one page
  naming the template, the parties and the content hash. Honest paper for a
  hash-attestation model, and the wrong paper for a contract — what landed in a
  counterparty's inbox was a list of identifiers, and they were asked to sign it
  with BankID. There was no way for a caller to supply the real one.

  **The seam.** A vertical uploads its rendered document onto the protocol instance
  and names it when binding; the freeze event carries the id; the connector opens it
  and sends those bytes:

  ```ts
  const doc = await attachments.upload({ entity: { entityType: 'protocol', entityId }, … });
  await scope.invoke('protocol/bind-document', { instanceId, contentRef, contentHash,
                                                 documentAttachmentId: doc.id });
  ```

  Bind nothing and today's sheet goes out unchanged, byte for byte — a vertical that
  renders nothing keeps working with no change.

  **By id, never by search.** The return path lands the sealed _signed_ copy on the
  same instance, so a connector that picked "the document on this instance" could
  mail a counterparty their own signed contract to sign again. Naming an id makes
  that unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely, and removes the only real design
  question the issue raised.

  **What the platform was actually missing.** The attachment store has existed since
  #473 and this connector already wrote through it on the return path — but the
  outbound leg needed a read that did not exist, in two different ways:

  - on `adapter-sqlite` a connector runs INSIDE the scope's actor task
    (`dispatchExecutors` is called from within `enqueue`), and every verb of the
    ordinary attachment surface re-enqueues on that actor — so reading from a
    dispatch wedged the scope, silently, forever. `dispatchConnector` does _not_
    enqueue, so a naive implementation works on the routed path and hangs under
    `invoke`/`drainDue`. Pinned in `adapter-sqlite/test/connector-reads.test.ts`.

    The adapter is therefore _told_ which case it is in rather than assuming the
    worse one. Building the read reentrant everywhere would work, and would quietly
    drop the platform-dispatch path out of K-6 serialization: a read on the same
    SQLite connection while another task holds a transaction open sees that task's
    uncommitted rows. There is a test in which the actor is deliberately busy and
    the read must wait for it — that wait is the serialization, made visible.

  - on the hosted Cloudflare path only `upload` crossed the `/internal` connector
    seam, so the control plane held the credential while the vertical held the bytes.

  New in the kernel: **`ScopedConnectorConnection`** — what `ctx.connection(provider)`
  returns inside a dispatch — with **`openAttachment(id)`**: reads only, by id only,
  gated by the target's `readPermission` against that connection's own grants.

  It hangs off the connection rather than the context deliberately, and the first cut
  of this change got it wrong in a way worth recording. Authorizing the read against
  an ambient "the provider this connector is registered under" is a _second name_ for
  the credential the handler already holds, and two names for one fact is how they come
  to disagree: `registerScriveConnector({ id: 'scrive-eu' })` opens its credential as
  `'scrive'` and would have read as `'scrive-eu'` — the egress half kept working while
  every contract's document half failed with `no live 'scrive-eu' connection`. Handing
  the door to whoever holds the credential makes that unrepresentable, and removes the
  ambient-provider plumbing (and a `dispatchConnector` option) entirely. A connection
  reopened _outside_ a dispatch — a credential probe, a poll driver — has no scope to
  read from and stays a plain `ConnectorConnection`, so the type says which is which
  instead of handing out a method that would have to throw.

  `ConnectorDelegation` gains `openAttachment`, backed by
  `GET /internal/connector-attachment/:id` (raw bytes, record in a header — a contract
  is megabytes and base64 in JSON would inflate it for nothing).

  `engine-protocol` gains migration `0004-bound-document` and an optional
  `documentAttachmentId` on `bindDocument`, carried additively onto
  `protocol.content-bound` (with the kernel's own `sha256`), `protocol.signatures-requested`
  and `protocol.signed`. `bindDocument` refuses an attachment that is not on the
  instance being bound — the reconciliation belongs where the document and the hash
  are first named together.

  **Permission diff.** A connection now needs `protocol:read` to send the vertical's
  document. Meridian's `connectScrive` grants it, and also `protocol:attach`, which
  was missing — the sealed-copy landing has been failing there and reporting itself
  as a `skipped` reason rather than an error, so nobody was told.

  **Not a silent fallback.** A named-but-unreadable document is a hard failure. Once
  a vertical has said which bytes its signatory must see, substituting other paper is
  quieter than a refusal and worse, because a document still goes out and someone
  still signs it. The dispatch dead-letters; the ledger row is written only after
  `start`, so the retry after the fix sends the right document.

  `engine-test-kit` gains an opt-in `attachments` option — an engine's declared
  `attachmentTargets` could not be exercised there at all before, because the
  harness's scope had no vertical and so no blob store.

- c19e371: fix: a connector failure is readable, and a refused request is no longer retried for two days

  The console's card for a broken Scrive connection said, in full: `Error · scrive · Last error 7m
ago: HTTP 409 from scrive`. The real message was nine words longer and contained the whole
  answer — `Authentication to sign for participant #1 requires valid personal number field`. It
  was journaled correctly by `settlePlatformRequest` and retained; it was simply not reachable
  from anywhere a builder would look. Getting at it meant the read-only SQL console with system
  tables toggled on, or a break-glass `scope pull --full`.

  It cost a production tenant a fortnight. Three signature requests, none of which ever reached a
  counterparty: two `failed` after **100 attempts over two days**, one still `pending` at 78 and
  counting — all on the same permanent client error. The contracts sat in `pending_signature`
  throughout, and the app had nothing to tell the user.

  - **The intent journal is readable.** `_substrat_platform_requests` had one reader,
    `listPlatformRequests`, which returns only `pending` rows — so a _settled_ intent, the only
    kind that holds an answer, was invisible by construction. Its complement,
    `ScopeHost.listPlatformRequestHistory` (`kind` / `status` / `limit`, newest first), is served
    through the vertical's `/internal` surface and the control plane's new
    `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/intents`, and rendered in the dashboard's integration detail as
    "Delivery attempts": id, status, attempts, timings, what was sent, and `lastError`
    **verbatim** — truncating it would rebuild the exact wall the section exists to remove.
  - **A 4xx settles terminal on the first attempt.** `pending` means _try again_, and every throw
    got it by default: right for a provider outage, wrong for a provider's refusal. A 4xx is the
    provider telling the caller its request is wrong; attempt 101 sends the identical bytes.
    `isTerminalProviderError` classifies structurally on the error's `status`, so no host imports
    a connector's error class — and 5xx, 408, 423, 425, 429 and anything with no status stay
    retryable, because a failure you cannot classify must never be settled terminally. Two days of
    silent retries becomes one settled row with the provider's own sentence on it.
  - **A terminal settle is visible to an operator.** It now lands an ops-failure row
    (`stage: 'terminal'`), the same treatment the attempt ceiling already had. A give-up and a
    refusal end the same way — nobody is coming back to the intent — so they deserve the same
    headline.
  - **A vertical can read the outcome of its own intents.** `ctx.platformRequests(filter)` is the
    read half of `ctx.requestPlatform`, which had none: an app could ask the platform to do
    something and then had no supported way to learn whether it happened. This is what lets a
    contract screen say the signing request never left, instead of showing a document that appears
    to be out for signature and is not. Read-only by construction — the kernel owns every write to
    that table.

  `ScopeHost` gained `listPlatformRequestHistory` and `OperationContext` gained
  `platformRequests`; both in-tree adapters implement them and the contract-test suite holds them.
  The 409 itself is a connector/engine gap, filed separately.

- 778f48a: Connection grants now reach scopes provisioned after the grant (#592). `grantToConnection` records each grant directory-side alongside the enforcement tuple (`_substrat_connection_grants`, tombstoned by `revokeConnection`'s cascade, readable via `HostAdmin.listConnectionGrants` and `GET /tenants/:tenantId/connection-grants`), and provision/reconcile gather those rows and deliver them per scope — the same authoritative channel as entitlements (#310) and identity links (#406) — so the connector return path works on every install without a human replaying grants, and a revoked connection's grants stop being delivered.

- 1fa4bd0: feat: the connector write-back seam — the platform runs the connector pass for CP-less verticals (#574 phase 1)

  A CP-less dispatch vertical cannot run a connector: the connection directory and
  its sealed secrets live platform-side, and a pushed script must never hold them.
  This lands the approved shape's first phase — the shared control plane runs the
  connector pass FOR dispatch verticals, and the vertical opens one narrow
  write-back door:

  - `vertical-host` mounts three platform-secret-gated verbs:
    `/internal/connector-invoke` (one operation, invoked as the connection),
    `/internal/connector-attachment` (the multipart bytes leg), and
    `/internal/connector-grant` (delivery of the scope-local `connection:<id>`
    grant tuple). Authorization happens in the scope's own DO against that
    delivered tuple — the platform cannot skip the permission check.
  - `CloudflareScopeHost` gains the far-end local methods
    (`connectorInvokeLocal` / `connectorAttachmentUploadLocal` /
    `connectorGrantLocal`) and a `connectorDelegation` option for the platform
    end: with it set, `getConnectorScope().invoke`, `getConnectorAttachments()`
    upload, and scope-level `grantToConnection` ride the delegation to the
    deployment actually serving the scope instead of touching the control plane's
    own module-less scope namespace. Directory gates (live connection,
    tenant/vertical match) still run platform-side before every delegated call.
  - `VerticalClient` speaks the three verbs (`connectorInvoke`,
    `connectorUploadAttachment`, `connectorGrant`).
  - The control plane wires the delegation into its host, seals/opens connection
    credentials with a new `SECRET_BOX_KEY` secret (base64 of 32 bytes, the
    dashboard's exact convention; canonical name `CP_SECRET_BOX_KEY` in
    secrets.mjs), and registers the Scrive sweeper on its scheduled
    `runPlatformSweep` pass — the poll floor now covers hosted verticals'
    connections. `SCRIVE_BASE_URL` selects the provider environment (default:
    testbed).

  Phase 2 (webhook ingress terminating on the platform) and phase 3 (outbound
  dispatch riding platform-requests) follow.

### Patch Changes

- a16a3d4: fix(vertical-host,control-plane): a platform fault answers 502, and the control plane keeps its own logs (#559)

  The `/internal/*` error envelope defaulted every unrecognized throw to 400 — so a
  Cloudflare DO SQLite storage fault (`internal error; reference = <id>`) crossed the
  control plane's verbatim passthrough and reached CI dressed as "you sent a bad
  request", unresolvable by anyone but Cloudflare support and invisible to every
  retry convention that (correctly) refuses to retry a 4xx. The envelope now
  recognizes infrastructure-fault shapes — workerd's `retryable`/`overloaded` flags,
  the redacted DO SQLite message, DO resets — answers 502 with the message intact,
  and logs `vertical-host.platform-fault` structured so the vertical's observability
  keeps stage + reference queryable. App errors that merely mention "internal error"
  mid-sentence stay 400; explicit HTTPException statuses stay authoritative.

  The control-plane worker also gains `observability: enabled` (prod and env.test):
  its own `deploy.upload.failed` / `control-plane.unhandled` diagnostics previously
  existed only in a live `wrangler tail`.

### Minor Changes

- 54d3d0e: Add `@substrat-run/vertical-host` — the platform's `/internal/*` management contract
  (provision, reconcile, introspection, the read-only SQL console, platform-request drain,
  snapshot/delete/export/restore, bookmarks/rewind, configure) plus the guaranteed `{ error }`
  response envelope, authored once and mounted with `mountPlatformSurface(app, deps)`.

  Verticals no longer hand-copy these routes and a Hono `onError` into their own `worker.ts` —
  copies that had already drifted (route sets disagreed; some workers shipped without the error
  handler, so a failing `/internal/restore` reached the control plane as the runtime's bare
  `Internal Server Error` with no diagnosis, issue #510). Meridian, Manyfold and the
  `create-substrat` template now mount the shared surface; a repo-wide `hono` override pins a
  single version so the mounted `Hono` app type matches its consumers.
