### Patch Changes

- d93e690: Detachable vertical auth (docs/design/vertical-auth-detach.md): auth moves out of the
  verticals and becomes an install-time choice — a team Auth Server app or any external
  OIDC issuer — with `builtin` (embedded Better Auth) as the unchanged default.

  **auth-server** is now a real multi-instance vertical: one issuer DO per scope behind
  the router (own users, signing secret, JWKS per install), the fixed-name single issuer
  standalone. It implements the K-31 surface (`/internal/provision`, `/internal/configure`)
  and answers unknown `/internal/*` paths with JSON — never the SPA fallback that
  surfaced as "Provisioning failed — internal error".

  **Config delivery seam** (control-plane-api): `VerticalClient.configureInstance` +
  `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/configure` deliver per-instance config to the deployment
  holding the scope's DO (bound-version resolution, 501 when there is nowhere to deliver);
  `ProvisionInstanceInput` gains optional `config` so an app arrives configured
  atomically. The dashboard Env tab now delivers after authoring (`delivered` flag).

  **RP flow** (vertical-auth): `oidcRpAuthProvider` — the full server-side
  Authorization-Code + PKCE relying party as an `AuthProvider`, cookie sessions signed
  with a per-tenant DO-minted secret, bearer fallback for API clients. The IdentityDO
  stores platform-delivered per-scope config and keeps the provider-agnostic
  `sub → principal` directory (TOFU owner claim + invites) under every mode. Meridian
  selects its provider per scope from the delivered `substrat:auth`; its SPA renders a
  redirect sign-in and invite-accept in OIDC mode. jose is bumped to v6 so node JWKS
  fetching goes through `fetch`, matching workerd.

  **Install-time identity** (dashboard): the New-app form's Identity section — builtin,
  a team Auth Server (the app is auto-registered there via RFC 7591 dynamic client
  registration against its real bound hostname), or an external issuer. Wiring failures
  mark the app failed with the reason on its audit trail.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- cb6131c: docs: point every published package's `homepage` at its substrat.net page and
  swap the stale `substrat.ahlstrand.es` doc links in READMEs for `substrat.net`.
  Add the three missing READMEs (`engine-booking`, `cli`, `control-plane-api`).
  Metadata/docs only — no code or API change; a republish is needed for the
  updated README + homepage to render on npm.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 6a7768a: Recognize `auth-do.ts` as harness. A Durable Object that wires an authentication adapter
  (Better Auth over the DO's own SQLite) is the workerd analogue of the already-exempt
  `auth-node.ts` — edge auth wiring, not module code — so its `fetch` request-interface method
  is no longer mistaken for a network call by the R3 rule.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- d0cb7a6: Treat `page.ts` and `oidc.ts` as harness. A served SPA (an HTML/JS string the worker
  returns) is edge wiring, not module code reachable from a `ModuleRegistration` — its
  `fetch` is browser code. `oidc.ts` is an OIDC relying party at the server edge (token
  exchange, JWKS) — the same node/network-touching auth-adapter class as `auth.ts`.
  Both added to `DEFAULT_HARNESS` alongside `worker.ts`/`routes.ts`, so R3 (no network
  in module code) no longer false-positives on a vertical's served page or auth edge.
- 0572a3b: **Typecheck on the native (Go) TypeScript compiler — `typescript` 5.6 → 7.**

  TypeScript 7 (the native compiler, formerly the `tsgo`/`@typescript/native-preview`
  rewrite) is now GA as `typescript@latest`. The binary is still `tsc`, so every package's
  `tsc -p … --noEmit` script is unchanged — only the toolchain pin moves. No source or
  public API changes; this bumps the published packages solely because their build now runs
  through the native compiler.

  Full-workspace `pnpm -r typecheck` drops to ~3s wall; per-package the native checker is
  roughly an order of magnitude faster (kernel 1.33s → 0.07s, control-plane-api 1.50s →
  0.12s, engine-invoicing 0.91s → 0.06s on this machine).

  Two migration deltas TS7's stricter resolution surfaced (both green on 5.6, red on 7):

  - **CSS side-effect imports (`TS2882`).** `import './ui.css'` in the six Vite app/admin
    surfaces now needs an ambient declaration. Fixed the way `demos/meridian/app` already
    did it — `"types": ["vite/client"]` in each app `tsconfig.json` (vite/client declares
    `*.css`) — rather than adding a stray `vite-env.d.ts`.
  - **`boundary-lint` node globals (`TS2584`/`TS2591`).** The linter CLI's `process`,
    `console`, and `node:fs`/`node:path` imports stopped resolving because the base tsconfig
    leaves `types` unset and TS7 no longer implicitly pulls in `@types/node` here. Added an
    explicit `"types": ["node"]` to `packages/boundary-lint/tsconfig.json`.

  Note: TS7 is a major bump that drops deprecated 5.x behavior. Editors should run their
  TS Server on 7 to keep CLI and IDE diagnostics aligned.
