### Minor Changes

- 74c9d7b: Add `unassignRole` and `unlinkIdentity` to the `HostAdmin` surface — the inverses of `assignRole` and `linkIdentity`, so authority granted through the kernel can also be taken back.

  - `unassignRole(actor, assignment)` revokes a role assignment by tombstoning the role tuple (K-21): the checker stops resolving it, the tuple stays as audit evidence, and a later `assignRole` of the same `(principal, role, node)` reactivates it. Idempotent.
  - `unlinkIdentity(actor, tenantId, principal)` severs a principal's login from a tenant — keyed by principal (so the caller needs no external subject) and a DELETE rather than a tombstone, so `listIdentityTenants`/`resolveIdentity` stop returning it and a re-invite can re-link a fresh principal.

  Both are implemented in the SQLite and Cloudflare adapters (with a generic tenant/scope tuple revoke on the Cloudflare DOs) and add matching `adminAction` log entries. Together they unblock self-serve member removal: cut a member's access and drop the team from their surface.

## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- 0572a3b: **Typecheck on the native (Go) TypeScript compiler — `typescript` 5.6 → 7.**

  TypeScript 7 (the native compiler, formerly the `tsgo`/`@typescript/native-preview`
  rewrite) is now GA as `typescript@latest`. The binary is still `tsc`, so every package's
  `tsc -p … --noEmit` script is unchanged — only the toolchain pin moves. No source or
  public API changes; this bumps the published packages solely because their build now runs
  through the native compiler.

  Full-workspace `pnpm -r typecheck` drops to ~3s wall; per-package the native checker is
  roughly an order of magnitude faster (kernel 1.33s → 0.07s, control-plane-api 1.50s →
  0.12s, engine-invoicing 0.91s → 0.06s on this machine).

  Two migration deltas TS7's stricter resolution surfaced (both green on 5.6, red on 7):

  - **CSS side-effect imports (`TS2882`).** `import './ui.css'` in the six Vite app/admin
    surfaces now needs an ambient declaration. Fixed the way `demos/meridian/app` already
    did it — `"types": ["vite/client"]` in each app `tsconfig.json` (vite/client declares
    `*.css`) — rather than adding a stray `vite-env.d.ts`.
  - **`boundary-lint` node globals (`TS2584`/`TS2591`).** The linter CLI's `process`,
    `console`, and `node:fs`/`node:path` imports stopped resolving because the base tsconfig
    leaves `types` unset and TS7 no longer implicitly pulls in `@types/node` here. Added an
    explicit `"types": ["node"]` to `packages/boundary-lint/tsconfig.json`.

  Note: TS7 is a major bump that drops deprecated 5.x behavior. Editors should run their
  TS Server on 7 to keep CLI and IDE diagnostics aligned.

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- a277bb7: **Fix: a migration whose comment or string literal contains a semicolon no longer fails only on
  Durable Objects.**

  The two scope-host adapters applied module migrations differently, and that divergence was a
  latent trap:

  - the **SQLite** adapter hands the whole migration blob to better-sqlite3's `exec`, which parses
    comments, string literals, and multiple statements correctly;
  - the **Cloudflare** adapter ran `migration.sql.split(';')` and `exec`'d each fragment — a naive
    split that truncates a statement the moment a `;` appears inside a `--` / `/* */` comment or a
    string literal. SQLite then reports `incomplete input`.

  So a migration could be **green on every node test and CI run, then fail only on `workerd`** in
  production. (Found porting Meridian to Cloudflare: an `hr_absence_ledger` column comment read
  `-- signed decimal days; balance = SUM(delta)` and broke `CREATE TABLE`.)

  The fix replaces the naive split with `splitSqlStatements` — a small SQL-aware scanner that skips
  line and block comments, copies string literals through verbatim (including the `''` escape), and
  splits only on a top-level `;`. Comments are dropped from emitted statements, so a trailing
  comment can never become a comment-only fragment that `exec` rejects either.

  To make the class of bug unmissable and keep the adapters from diverging again, the shared
  contract-test module `testMod`'s migration now deliberately contains all the hard cases — a `;` in
  a line comment, in a block comment, and in a string-literal `DEFAULT`, plus a second statement.
  Every suite that provisions a scope therefore exercises it on **both** adapters; a naive splitter
  fails provisioning outright. `splitSqlStatements` also has direct unit coverage of each edge case.

- 7e17b16: **Connector state, and idempotent dispatch — the Scrive connector no longer duplicates
  documents on retry.**

  The connector took an injected `onDispatched` callback because it had nowhere to record what
  it had done. Delivery is at-least-once, so a redelivery created a _second_ Scrive document —
  duplicate legal paperwork to real signatories.

  The obvious fix — write the dispatch record into the scope — **deadlocks**, confirmed with a
  spike: a connector runs inside the scope's post-commit dispatch, and re-entering the scope
  actor from there waits on the task that is waiting for it. So the ledger lives in the
  **directory**, which a connector reaches through `ctx.admin` without touching the scope:

  ```ts
  HostAdmin.putConnectorState(connectionId, key, value);
  HostAdmin.getConnectorState(connectionId, key);
  ```

  Arbitrary JSON, keyed by `(connection, key)`, in a new `_substrat_connector_state` directory
  table on both adapters. Not audited — high-frequency machine state, one write per dispatch, the
  same class as `recordConnectionUse`. It dies with the connection: revoke cascades.

  The connector now checks the ledger before creating a document and skips if a prior dispatch is
  recorded, then records the dispatch after `start`. `onDispatched` is gone. A narrow residual
  window remains (ledger write fails after `start` succeeds → the retry still duplicates),
  closable with provider-side dedup via the `substrat_instance` tag the connector now sets.

  `getConnectorScope` (from #108) is deliberately unused here: recording a _signature_ back into
  the scope is the poll driver's job, where it runs as a top-level operation and re-entry is
  safe. Dispatch idempotency is not a scope write and must not be one.

  Contract tests on both adapters cover the state round-trip, upsert, and revoke-cascade; the
  connector's own suite proves a recorded dispatch is skipped rather than repeated.

- e4db6ed: **`HostAdmin.listConnectorState` — the read a poll driver needs to find its own outstanding work.**

  `getConnectorState(id, key)` answers "did I already do THIS one" from a deterministic key — the
  dispatch-idempotency path. It cannot answer "what is still outstanding", because a poller does
  not know the keys up front:

  ```ts
  listConnectorState(id: ConnectionId, prefix?: string): Promise<{ key: string; value: unknown }[]>
  ```

  Returns every state row for a connection, optionally narrowed to keys under `prefix`, ordered by
  key. A connector records one row per dispatch under `<provider>:dispatch:<id>`, and a scheduled
  sweep enumerates them (`prefix = '<provider>:dispatch:'`) to reconcile each against the provider.
  Without this a sweep would have to be handed every id it might reconcile, which defeats the point
  of a sweep.

  A directory-local machine read, the same class as `getConnectorState` — not audited. Implemented
  on both adapters (sqlite in-process; Cloudflare on the control-plane DO, prefix filtered
  coordinator-side to avoid LIKE/GLOB escaping); the contract-test suite covers prefix narrowing,
  ordering, the empty-match case, and per-connection isolation, so both adapters are held to the
  same behaviour.

  This is the enumeration half of the Scrive connector's poll path (#96): `drainDue` and the new
  `sweepScriveReconciliations` both still need a _timer_ to call them, which remains a deployment
  concern (no cron/alarm exists yet).

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c1f0bb: **The connection store, and the first encryption primitive in the codebase.**

  Per-tenant credentials for external providers had nowhere to live. `master-plan.md §6`
  committed to a connection store; `kernel-design.md §1` deferred "the integrations hub beyond
  its contract stub", and the stub was never written either — no `Connection` type, no
  credential storage, nothing.

  **Keyed on (tenant, vertical, provider)**, not tenant alone. A vertical is a blast-radius
  boundary (D-30) and verticals are built by different companies (D-33), so one vendor's host
  code must not reach a credential another vendor connected for the same tenant. It also
  matches how OAuth issues clients. Cross-vertical sharing, if a real case ever appears, is an
  explicit grant rather than the default.

  **`SecretBox` is a new adapter surface** — D-18 classifies the KMS as an adapter. Before this
  every `crypto.subtle` call in the repo was a one-way digest and every secret was a plaintext
  Worker binding: nothing per-tenant, nothing rotatable, nothing encrypted at rest.
  `webCryptoSecretBox` (AES-256-GCM, fresh IV per seal, key id for rotation) is the default;
  Cloudflare Secrets Store or an external KMS drop in behind the same interface. A host with no
  `SecretBox` **refuses to store a credential** rather than storing one in the clear.

  Two leaks designed out rather than remembered:

  - `_substrat_admin_log.before`/`after` take arbitrary JSON and the log is **append-only**, so
    a credential written there could never be removed. Connection mutations log metadata only.
  - `adminAction` is a closed enum that `auditLog` parses _every_ row through, so unrecognised
    actions fail the read of the whole log. Three members added.

  Revoking **destroys the sealed blob** and tombstones the row: a grant that once existed is
  evidence of why an access was allowed (K-21), but keeping the usable credential would make it
  a liability. Uniqueness is over live rows, so a revoked connection can be replaced.

  New on `HostAdmin`: `createConnection`, `listConnections`, `updateConnectionSecret`,
  `revokeConnection`, `openConnection`, `recordConnectionUse`. `openConnection` takes no actor
  and is not audited — the same exemption `resolveHostname` and `resolveIdentity` hold, for the
  same reason: an audit row per outbound HTTP call would drown the log that matters. Health
  (`lastOkAt`/`lastError`) is what an operator can act on instead.

  Ten new **contract** tests, so both adapters must agree — including that the credential
  appears in neither a metadata read nor the audit log, that another vertical cannot open it,
  and that revoking destroys it.

  **These methods take a `PlatformActorId`, which is a deliberate deferral, not an answer.**
  Connecting a provider is a tenant admin's act, and routing it through a platform actor is the
  defect D-31 named for `addMember`. Recorded in `docs/design/connections.md` §3.5; no console
  flow should be built on this signature until the question is settled with membership's.

- 113160a: **The inbound authority seam (#97): a connection is a subject.**

  A provider's callback has to write back into a scope, and it is not a person. `getScope`
  demands a `PrincipalId`, so a connector could dispatch a document and then be unable to record
  that it had — which under at-least-once delivery means a retry sends a **second** one.

  ```ts
  getConnectorScope(connectionId, scopeId): Promise<ScopeStub>;
  grantToConnection(actor, grant): Promise<void>;
  ```

  **The door inherits its narrowing.** A connection is keyed (tenant, vertical, provider), so
  `getConnectorScope` refuses another tenant's scope, another vertical's scope, and a revoked
  connection — none of it re-declared, just the key enforced where it could have been widened.

  **Authority is an ordinary permission grant**, not a second mechanism. Tuples already expire,
  tombstone on revoke (K-21), carry a proof, and appear in the permission diff. A parallel
  "allowed operations" list — the first design — would have been a second gate that only one of
  the two would show up in a review.

  **A connection is not a person, and the model now says so.** `PermissionChecker.check` takes a
  `CheckSubject` (`{ kind: 'principal' } | { kind: 'connection' }`) instead of a `PrincipalId`.
  Minting a principal per connection would have been cheaper and wrong: every audit view would
  show a `principal:` subject for something that is not one — the confusion `PlatformActorId`'s
  separate brand exists to prevent. So the tuple proof reads `connection:01J…`, the event actor
  is `{ connection }` beside the existing `{ system }`, and membership expansion is skipped for a
  connection rather than queried — it belongs to no org and holds no role, so a role carrying a
  permission cannot leak into it.

  **Breaking for custom checkers.** Any `PermissionChecker` implementation must take a
  `CheckSubject`; `asPrincipal(id)` is exported for the common case. Both built-in adapters and
  the contract suite are updated.

  Five new tests in the permission contract suite, against the real tuple checker on both
  adapters: opening the door confers nothing · a grant allows exactly what it names and proves it
  with a `connection:` tuple · no roles or memberships leak in · another tenant's or vertical's
  scope is unreachable · revoking the connection closes the door in the same act that destroys
  the credential.

- 3fb38da: **`registerConnector` — an executor that also gets a credential and sanctioned egress.**

  The existing `ExecutorHandler` receives only `HostAdmin`, which is right for the one executor
  that exists (a directory write) and insufficient for anything that talks to a provider: no
  per-tenant credential, and no way to make an HTTP call that the platform can police.

  ```ts
  registerConnector(id, eventType, handler, options?)

  interface ConnectorContext {
    admin; tenantId; scopeId; vertical;
    connection(provider): Promise<ConnectorConnection>;   // opened credential + bound fetch
  }
  ```

  **Tenant and vertical are ambient**, taken from the event's scope rather than passed in, so a
  connector cannot reach a credential another vertical connected even by accident.

  **`fetch` is bound to the connection, not to the context.** Health has to land on the right
  row by construction; an ambient `ctx.fetch` would make the runtime guess which connection a
  call belonged to, and it would guess wrong the first time a connector talked to two. The
  handler is _given_ its fetch rather than importing one — the same move `ctx.sql` makes for
  module code, and for the same reason: timeouts, egress policy and health become properties of
  the seam instead of conventions an author has to remember.

  Kept as a second registration rather than widening `ExecutorHandler`: a membership executor
  should not be handed the machinery to call the internet. Both ride the same hardened dispatch,
  journal and retry policy from #100.

  Hosts take an optional `fetch`, so a provider can be stood up in memory. That is the only way
  to exercise a connector end to end before vendor credentials exist, and it stays useful
  afterwards because a real provider will not return 503 on demand.

  Three new contract tests across both adapters: a connector receives its tenant's credential and
  records health on success; a provider error is recorded on the connection; and a tenant with
  the SKU but no connection fails the delivery visibly rather than silently doing nothing.

- 2becfd5: **Executor deliveries retry, back off, and dead-letter instead of escaping the operation.**

  `ExecutorHandler` is the only outbound seam in the system. That was fine while the only
  executor wrote to the local directory; it stops being fine the moment one makes an HTTP
  call, which is the most likely thing in the system to fail transiently.

  Three specific defects, all fixed:

  - **A throwing handler escaped `invoke()` after the transaction committed.** The caller
    was told their work failed when it had not. A delivery failure and an operation failure
    are different facts, and only the second belongs in the caller's result.
  - **A poison event wedged the queue permanently.** The scan is `ORDER BY o.id`, so the
    failing event was re-selected first on every drain and executor _N+1_ never ran while
    _N_ threw.
  - **Nothing retried on its own.** With no timer anywhere, a failed delivery was retried
    only if someone happened to invoke another operation on that same scope — and nothing
    reported that it hadn't.

  New surface:

  ```ts
  registerExecutor(id, eventType, handler, retry?: ExecutorRetryPolicy)
  drainDue(tenantId, scopeId): Promise<ExecutorDrainReport>
  executorDeadLetters(tenantId, scopeId): Promise<ExecutorDeadLetter[]>
  ```

  Retry policy is **per executor** rather than a host constant: the defaults suit a
  directory write, and a connector making an outbound call wants a longer tail.
  `_substrat_deliveries` gains `attempts` and `next_attempt_at`, added by `ALTER` on both
  adapters — the defaults read as "terminal", which is correct for every row already there.
  Consumer dispatch is untouched.

  Behavioural change worth noting: an operation can now report success while its external
  effect has not happened yet. That is the correct semantics for an outbox, and it is what
  the path was already doing silently — the difference is that failures are now recorded,
  retried, and readable instead of being thrown at whoever held the request.

  Prerequisite for the integrations hub ([`docs/design/connections.md`](docs/design/connections.md)).
  Scheduling `drainDue` from a cron trigger or Durable Object alarm is not included here.

### Patch Changes

- d881f75: **Correct the Scrive connector against the real API, and widen the connector fetch body.**

  The connector was written from Scrive's docs. Driving the full lifecycle against
  `api-testbed.scrive.com` exposed three things the docs left ambiguous and the docs-reading got
  wrong — exactly the "a mock encodes the author's reading of the docs" caveat cashing out:

  - **Auth is OAuth1 PLAINTEXT, not OAuth2 bearer.** The Scrive UI's "Client credentials" and
    "Token credentials" are two halves of one four-part signature, not two schemes. The
    connection secret shape becomes `{ clientId, clientSecret, tokenId, tokenSecret }`.
  - **`POST /documents/new` returns no top-level `status`** — only `get` does. The connector now
    parses mutation responses for their id and reads status from `get`, which is the right design
    regardless (don't trust a mutation's echo).
  - **`setfile` is `multipart/form-data`**, not a base64 body.

  The kernel change: `ConnectorRequestInit.body` accepts `Uint8Array` as well as `string`, because
  a real upload is binary and a string body corrupts the file. Web `fetch` accepts both, so the
  adapters pass it straight through.

  `ScriveMock` is updated to the real request encodings (OAuth1 header, form-encoded `update`,
  multipart `setfile`, exactly-one-author) so it fails a connector regression rather than passing
  a shape the real API rejects. A new opt-in `test/live.test.ts` drives the real lifecycle when
  testbed credentials are present and skips otherwise, so CI stays offline while a local run
  verifies against reality.

  Still incomplete: the write-back (needs `getConnectorScope`, now available on `HostAdmin`) and a
  poll driver. And `se_bankid`-to-sign is disabled on the testbed account, so the BankID
  round-trip is unverified.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 27872cc: Scopes are provisioned as `provisioning` and activated on confirmation (K-31).

  `provisionScope` wrote the directory row as `active`, so the row claimed a usable
  scope before anything had built one — and only the vertical can build one, because the
  DO class bundles the modules and lives in the vertical's deployment. The `provisioning`
  state existed in the enum for exactly this and was unused.

  `HostAdmin.activateScope` moves `provisioning → active`, through the same transition
  graph the other lifecycle moves use, so it is audited and cannot revive a suspended
  scope. `getScope` refuses anything not active, so an unconfirmed row is inert rather
  than misleading.

  `ControlPlaneClient.activateScope` is the push-mode equivalent, and the control-plane
  API gains `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/activate`.

  Migrations are still attempted for a `provisioning` scope before it is refused, so the
  lazy retry and its attempt counter survive — they are the only self-healing there is
  until the reconciliation sweep exists. A scope held back by a failed migration now
  reports the migration error rather than a bare "not active".

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c54637b: The hostname map: `hostname → (tenant, scope, vertical, surface, region)`.

  A provisioned scope had no URL, so "validate it works in production" had nowhere to
  point. `contracts/routing.ts` adds `hostnameBinding` and `routeTarget`, and `HostAdmin`
  adds `bindHostname` / `setHostnameStatus` / `listHostnames` / `resolveHostname`.

  `surface` is the correction: one hostname per scope was already wrong, because a single
  scope fronts a storefront and a back office, or a player app and a manager console.

  `region` sits on the binding rather than in a router deployed per jurisdiction, because
  Cloudflare's Regional Services is configured per hostname — residency is one more
  column, not a second topology.

  Bindings have a lifecycle (`pending` → `verifying` → `active`, or `failed` with a note),
  since a custom domain is DNS validation and certificate issuance rather than a string
  somebody sets. Only `active` resolves. `resolveHostname` takes no actor and is not
  logged — the machine-path carve-out `resolveIdentity` already has — and does not
  re-check suspension, which `getScope` owns.

  Additive on every published surface: new schemas, new `HostAdmin` methods, new tables.
  Nothing existing changed shape.

### Minor Changes

- 6900431: The directory becomes readable, and gets an HTTP surface.

  **New package: `@substrat-run/control-plane-api`** (AGPL-3.0-only + commercial,
  like the kernel it sits on). One Hono router over `HostAdmin` — the audited
  control-plane transport. Web-standard only, so the same router mounts in a Worker
  holding the `controlPlane` binding or behind a Node server. It is not module code:
  it never receives a `ctx` and never runs in a scope's serialization domain.

  **`HostAdmin` gains a read side.** The write side was complete; nothing could
  enumerate what it had written.

  - `listScopes(filter?)` / `getScopeRecord(tenantId, scopeId)` — the scope
    inventory §3.2 always claimed the directory was. `getScopeRecord` cross-checks
    the pair and returns `undefined` for another tenant's scope, the same
    fail-closed rule `getScope` applies (K-3).
  - `listRoles(filter?)` — roles were writable and not enumerable since the
    permission model shipped. Returns `TenantRole` (a `RoleDefinition` plus its
    tenant).
  - `auditLog(filter?)` widens: filter by scope, actor, action or time; `limit`,
    `cursor` and `order`. The cursor is the entry's own ULID — order is
    chronological, so a page carries its own continuation. **The default order is
    unchanged** (oldest first), so existing callers do not shift.

  **The `scope` contract is now enforced rather than aspirational.** It described
  `slug`/`kind`/`name`/`parentScopeId` and was parsed by nothing while the table had
  none of those columns. Every read now parses through it, and `Scope` gains
  `vertical`.

  **`ProvisionScopeInput` extends additively** — `slug`, `kind`, `name`, `vertical`
  are optional with behaviour-preserving defaults, so existing callers are
  untouched. An unnamed scope's slug defaults to its lowercased id (a ULID
  lowercases into a valid slug, so it is valid and unique by construction).

  **`schemaVersion` and `vertical` stop being placeholders.** Both shipped as
  columns written by nothing — `schemaVersion` was always `'0'`, `vertical` always
  `null`. `schemaVersion` is now the applied-migration count; `vertical` is stamped
  onto audit targets for scope-lifecycle actions.

  **Directory schema change, applied in place by both adapters.** The `scopes` table
  gains `parent_scope_id`/`slug`/`kind`/`name`/`vertical`, plus a unique index on
  `(tenant_id, slug)` and one on `tenants(slug)`. The directory is not a module and
  has no `SqlMigration[]` journal, so each adapter upgrades on open: add the columns,
  backfill legacy rows to the same defaults `resolveScopeRecord` applies, then create
  the unique indexes **after** the backfill (a unique index over NULL slugs would
  permit the duplicates it exists to forbid). No action is required of callers; an
  existing directory opens and migrates itself.

  **Slug uniqueness is now enforced**, which it never was despite the contract saying
  "unique within tenant". `createTenant` and `provisionScope` fail closed on a
  collision rather than reporting a silent no-op — `INSERT OR IGNORE` would have
  swallowed a colliding-slug-different-id create and reported it as idempotent.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5dd4085: Zod 4, and `contracts` re-exports `z` — closing a live from-scratch trap

  **The trap.** The published packages depend on `zod ^3.25.0` while `pnpm add zod`
  — which getting-started told users to run — installs Zod 4. pnpm resolves both:
  Zod 3 nested for our packages, Zod 4 for the user. Two copies, both "correct".
  Zod schemas do not compose across majors, so the moment a user wrote the pattern
  CLAUDE.md mandates ("operation inputs go through Zod schemas at the boundary")
  composing a contracts schema into their own —

                            z.object({ facility: entityRef, unitPrice: money })

  — it failed at RUNTIME with `Invalid element at key "facility": expected a Zod
schema`, an error pointing nowhere near the cause. Not an exotic pattern: it is
  what `engines/workorder` itself does (`unitPrice: money`, `facility: entityRef`),
  so anyone copying the reference hit it immediately. Found by building a vertical
  from scratch against the published packages — the flow the docs describe and
  nobody had walked.

  **Two fixes, because they solve different halves.**

  1. **Zod 4 everywhere.** Aligns with what the ecosystem installs by default, so a
     user who reaches for `zod` gets our major. No code changes were needed — the
     schema subset in use (`z.object`, `.regex`, `.brand`, `.min`, `.optional`,
     `z.infer`) is stable across the major, and the one `z.record` was already the
     2-arg form Zod 4 requires. Build, typecheck, and the full suite pass unchanged.
  2. **`contracts` re-exports `z`.** The durable half: importing `z` from
     `@substrat-run/contracts` means the consumer never installs zod at all, so the
     versions cannot diverge. Fix 1 makes the trap dormant; fix 2 keeps it dormant
     when Zod 5 ships.

  `zod` is dropped from the getting-started install line; docs and the `substrat`
  skill both import `z` from contracts.

  **Breaking for consumers on Zod 3** — deliberately taken now, while there are
  effectively none, rather than later when there are.

  **Still open:** making `zod` a `peerDependency`. Contracts' schemas are part of
  its public API — consumers are meant to compose them, so their copy must be ours
  — which is textbook peer. As a plain dependency it nests silently instead of
  failing at install. Left as a separate call.

- db77d8c: `HostAdmin` is now asynchronous

  Every `HostAdmin` method returns a `Promise` — writes (`createTenant`,
  `setTenantStatus`, the scope-lifecycle transitions, `defineRole`/`assignRole`/
  `grant`/`grantToOrg`/`addMember`, `grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement`,
  `linkIdentity`) and reads (`getTenant`, `listTenants`, `listEntitlements`,
  `auditLog`, `resolveIdentity`) alike. `registerModule`/`defineOperation` stay
  synchronous (code-time bookkeeping); `getScope`/`provisionScope` were already async.

  Why: the pure adapter's synchronous admin worked only because it is in-process.
  The Cloudflare adapter (D-14) proved a durable/remote control plane — a Durable
  Object — cannot be synchronous, so the second adapter forced the interface to
  evolve. This is the two-adapter discipline doing its job. Callers now `await`
  admin calls; adapter-sqlite's methods present their synchronous SQLite work as
  Promises. Behavior, error messages, and every contract assertion are unchanged.

- 4ba235e: Cloudflare Durable-Object adapter — milestone 1: contract suites green in workerd

  The second adapter (D-14) now runs the **shared** contract suites against **real
  Durable Objects** in workerd. One scope = one SQLite-backed `ScopeDO`; operations
  run inside `ctx.storage.transaction(async …)` (the DO analogue of the pure
  adapter's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT/ROLLBACK`), with per-scope serialization,
  lazy migrations-on-wake, guards, entity links, and the outbox→consumer dispatch
  loop. `scopeHostContractSuite` + `permissionContractSuite` pass unchanged (43
  pass, 1 skip); the pure-SQLite adapter stays green.

  - **contract-tests**: handlers extracted into an importable `modules.ts` so a DO
    can bundle them (a DO cannot execute closures created in another isolate);
    assertions unchanged. New `supportsRuntimeRegistration` capability flag — the
    one dynamic-late-registration test is skipped on adapters whose module set is
    code-time (CF), since a deployed DO bundle cannot gain code at runtime.
  - **kernel**: `ulid()` is now **monotonic** within a process (ULID spec's
    monotonic factory) — two ids minted in the same millisecond sort in creation
    order, making the audit log's and outbox's "ULID order is chronological"
    invariant actually hold. Fixes a latent same-millisecond ordering flake.

  Milestone-1 limitation, deliberately scoped: `HostAdmin` is a **synchronous**
  interface, which cannot be backed by an async Durable Object — so the coordinator
  holds the directory (tenants/scopes/entitlements/audit/identities/roles) in
  memory and forwards only the cross-DO subset (roles + tenant tuples) to a
  `ControlPlaneDO`. Making the control plane durable needs an async admin surface —
  a contract evolution the second adapter surfaced (exactly what D-14 is for), and
  the next step before deploying a real vertical.

- d929987: Control plane §4.3: entitlement store — `manifest.entitlementKey` finally gates loading

  `manifest.entitlementKey` was declared on every module and read by nothing (D-20
  was a promise with no mechanism). Now a per-tenant `_substrat_entitlements` set
  gates module loading, default-deny: an operation whose owning module's SKU flag
  the tenant does not hold does not resolve — the same fail-closed shape as manifest
  `withdraws`. New `HostAdmin.grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement` (idempotent,
  audited) and `listEntitlements`. The check runs per invoke (the simple, uncached
  path — a DO-cached variant is kernel-design open question 5). Entitlement flags
  are the SKUs meter 2 (§5) counts. Demo seeds grant the flags for the modules each
  vertical runs — the SKU model in use.

- f717014: Control plane §4.4: `PlatformActor` seam + append-only admin audit log (D-30, K-20)

  Every `HostAdmin` mutation (defineRole / assignRole / grant / grantToOrg / addMember)
  now takes a `PlatformActorId` — a staff subject branded distinctly from a tenant
  `PrincipalId` — and writes an append-only row to a new `_substrat_admin_log` in the
  directory, stamped host-side (actor, action, target, before/after, timestamp). A new
  `HostAdmin.auditLog(filter?)` reads it back — the read path for the console history and
  the permission-diff human checkpoint. `defineRole` captures the prior role in `before`.

  Pre-release breaking surface change kept at patch: `HostAdmin` method signatures gained
  a leading `actor` argument. Locally the actor is a dev stub; real staff auth gates
  exposing the surface, not building it.

- 6393a8e: Control plane §4.2: scope lifecycle + structural audit + mandatory tenant

  `provisionScope` becomes the first audited scope-lifecycle transition — it now
  takes a `PlatformActor`, requires an existing active tenant (a scope with no
  tenant record fails closed), and audits. New `HostAdmin.suspendScope`,
  `unsuspendScope`, `archiveScope`, and `unarchiveScope` implement the §3.3
  transitions, validate the legal transition graph (fail closed on an illegal
  one), and audit before/after; un-archive is an explicit restore, never a silent
  flag flip. `getScope` now gates on both tenant-active AND scope-active, so
  suspend/archive actually contain.

  Audit is now a single `recordAdmin` choke point every mutation routes through —
  "no mutation without a durable record" holds by construction, not per-method
  discipline. The step-2 "legacy scopes without a tenant" passthrough is removed:
  every scope has a tenant with a status.

- 2dd4175: Control plane §4.1: tenant registry + lifecycle status

  A real `tenants` table in the directory replaces "a tenant is a ULID nobody used
  before". New `HostAdmin.createTenant` (idempotent, audited), `setTenantStatus`,
  `listTenants`, and `getTenant`. A tenant whose status is not `active` fails
  `getScope` closed for every scope under it — the K-3 fail-closed path, the
  containment lever for non-payment or an incident, reversible without deletion.
  Scopes provisioned without a tenant record (legacy path) are not gated, keeping
  the change backward-compatible.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 604883b: Manifest-declared operation guards and operation withdrawal — compliance gates a reviewer can enumerate.

  A vertical declares an unconditional gate in its manifest (`guards: [{ before, predicate, config }]`); a module contributes the named predicate (`predicates` on `ModuleRegistration`, typed `GuardPredicate`); the kernel evaluates it inside the guarded operation's own transaction, before the handler, failing closed. `withdraws` lets a vertical suppress an engine's default operation binding so the guarded wrapper is the only door — without it a gate is reviewable but bypassable. Both are optional and additive: existing manifests parse and behave unchanged.

  The protocol engine gains a `protocol/all-signed` predicate and the `requireCountersigned` in-scope function; the work-order engine exports `closeWorkOrder` as an in-scope function (its `workorder/close` operation is now the thin binding). The scope-host contract suite covers guards and withdrawal, so every adapter must implement both.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7583dab: First end-to-end feature set: the kernel deltas that carry a running vertical.

  - **Contracts**: relationship tuples with proof-path `Decision`s (an unexplained allow is
    unrepresentable), entity-narrowed capability grants, `entityRelations` and `ui`
    contributions on the module manifest, shared `money` schema with exact decimal
    arithmetic, attachment `visibility` classification.
  - **Kernel**: `registerModule` (manifest + migrations + operations + consumers),
    `OperationContext.link`, entity-aware `PermissionChecker`, `HostAdmin` surface for
    roles/assignments/grants/membership, `assertAllowed`/`PermissionDenied`.
  - **adapter-sqlite**: built-in constrained tuple permission engine (fixed four-rule
    algebra, proof paths, grant expiry, org membership), per-scope migration journal
    (lazy on wake, crash-safe), per-operation transactions (writes and emitted events
    commit or roll back together), local at-least-once event dispatch with a kernel
    delivery journal and system-actor consumer contexts.
  - **contract-tests**: atomicity, migration-journal, dispatch exactly-once, and tuple
    permission suites — every adapter must pass all of them unchanged.
  - **Engines**: first releases of `@substrat-run/engine-workorder` (state machine, append-only
    time/material, fat completion events) and `@substrat-run/engine-invoicing` (event-consuming
    snapshot fakturaunderlag with provenance, immutable once exported).
