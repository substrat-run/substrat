- da69ef5: A conformance kit that catches a node check where an entity check was declared.

  An operation declaring `permission: { key, entity, idFrom }` beside a handler
  calling `ctx.check(perm)` typechecks perfectly and fails open — everyone holding
  the key anywhere in the scope passes, which in a sharing app is every member
  against every record. `entityCheckConformanceSuite` generates the behavioural
  pair that separates the two, per operation, read off the declaration:

  ```ts
  entityCheckConformanceSuite("todo", todoOperations, makeFixture, {
    inputs: { "todo/rename-list": { name: "renamed" } },
    uncovered: {
      "todo/set-item-done": "declares 'resolved' — the id is not in the input",
    },
  });
  ```

  Grant on entity A and invoke against A: a correct check allows, a node check
  denies, because a narrowed grant does not widen. Grant on A and invoke against B:
  a correct check denies. The second is the breach direction; the first is the one
  that catches the node check, and it fails as a _baffling denial_ rather than as a
  breach — the direction nobody files a security bug about. Case 2 deliberately
  does not catch the node check, and the suite says so rather than implying
  coverage it does not have.

  Operations the kit cannot generate — a `resolved` check, or one whose required
  input nobody supplied — are reported as uncovered and asserted against a list the
  caller writes down, so losing coverage turns CI red and appears in the diff.
  `planEntityCheckCoverage` is exported for anyone who wants the partition without
  the suite.

  `alsoGrant` records the permissions an operation needs beyond the one it
  declares, with a required reason. The first vertical it ran against produced one:
  a handler that delegates a permission via `ctx.grant` must itself hold the
  permission it delegates, so the declared key is the gate it opens with rather
  than the whole authority it exercises.

  Closes #747.

- 3b8533d: **zod is now a peer dependency.** Install it alongside these packages:

  ```sh
  npm install zod@^4.4.0
  ```

  Every package here hands out zod schemas that a consumer parses with, composes
  into their own, and that `mountOperations` reads `_zod.def` off to find pinned
  literals. Two copies of zod in one tree means an object made by one is not
  recognised by the other, and the symptom — `expected a Zod schema` — points
  nowhere near the cause. A peer dependency says _use the consumer's copy_.

  The declared range is `^4.4.0` rather than the exact version this repo builds
  against: a peer range should state what the code supports, and pinning it to
  `^4.4.3` would refuse a consumer on 4.4.0 for no reason.

  **A defect this found.** `@substrat-run/contract-tests` shipped **130
  `import("zod")` references in its published `.d.ts` while declaring zod
  nowhere.** It resolved only because contracts had zod as a regular dependency,
  which hoisted a copy into view — not a dependency, a coincidence. It now declares
  it. Two more of the same class turned up when the tree shifted: packages using
  `setTimeout`/`atob`/`btoa` — globals absent from `lib: ES2023` — compiling on an
  ambient `@types/node` nobody had declared.

  That is the general rule now enforced by `pnpm lint:deps`
  (`tools/declared-deps.mjs`) in CI: **every module a package references, in its
  source or its emitted `.d.ts`, must be one it declared.** The `.d.ts` half is the
  sharp one — TypeScript writes the original specifier into declarations however
  the source imported it, so re-exporting `z` through contracts still emits
  `import("zod")` into a dependent's types.

  **Why a lint rather than pnpm's own enforcement**, measured rather than assumed:
  `autoInstallPeers` (pnpm's default) turns a peer conflict into a silent second
  copy — with contracts peer-requiring `^4.4.3` and a consumer declaring `^3.23.0`,
  pnpm reported nothing, and `zod` did not appear once in the peer report even
  under `--strict-peer-dependencies`. And pnpm's peer checking does not reach
  `workspace:` links at all. Full reasoning in `docs/design/dependency-policy.md`.

  Internally, shared versions now come from a pnpm `catalog:` so one version is a
  single edit. The `pnpm` settings block moved from `package.json` to
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which is where pnpm 10 reads it — it had been ignored,
  with `overrides` surviving only because they were baked into the lockfile.

  Closes #742.

### Minor Changes

- f869541: `ctx.grant` / `ctx.revoke` — an operation may narrow a permission it holds onto
  one entity.

  Every entity-narrowed grant in the fleet is made at seed time by
  `HostAdmin.grant`, a platform actor's verb. So an app where a _person_ shares
  their own record with someone had no supported mechanism: `OperationContext`
  offered `check`, `link` and `emit`, and nothing that could widen access at
  runtime. The only way to ship such a feature was a membership table consulted by
  hand in every handler — the forgotten-WHERE-clause failure this platform exists
  to remove, reintroduced one vertical at a time.

  Found by building a vertical forward from its model rather than converting one
  that already existed: the todo demo's sharing feature is unbuildable without it,
  and no existing demo could reveal the gap because all of their entity-narrowed
  access is seeded.

  Non-escalating by construction:

  - **Entity-narrowed only.** `entity` is required, so module code can never write
    a scope-wide or tenant-wide grant.
  - **Delegation, never elevation.** The caller's own decision on that entity is
    re-checked inside the verb, so an operation can only hand out what it was
    itself given.

  Transactional with the operation, like rows and events: a grant made by an
  operation that then throws never happened.

  Pinned by five contract-suite cases both adapters run — the happy path, that the
  grant reaches that entity and nothing else, the refused elevation, a control
  proving a permission the caller _does_ hold still grants, and revoke. The
  refusal case is mutation-checked: removing the guard fails it.

- 9208b4e: A signature request can carry **how a party is reached** — sealed to the
  connector, never readable in the spine (#687 item 1,
  `docs/design/signature-contact-carrier.md`).

  Every external signature this platform has ever sent has failed. The reason was
  not the auth level and never was: `connector-scrive` mapped each party to a role
  label — "Beställare" — and no address, so Scrive answered
  `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` and a document started with nobody to deliver
  it to. `ScriveParty.email` was declared, wired into the provider's `fields`
  array, and filled by nothing. This is its producer.

  **Why it took a design.** The obvious carrier — put the address on the event —
  is unavailable: `protocol.signatures-requested` lands in `_substrat_outbox` and
  `_substrat_platform_requests`, kernel rows a vertical may neither write nor
  erase, so anything a hosted vertical emits in plaintext stays plaintext in copies
  it cannot reach. The next obvious one — seal it under the per-subject keys — is
  impossible rather than merely awkward: those keys live in the directory, and a
  sandbox-clean vertical is architecturally on the far side of that boundary
  (§2 of the design derives it). And reading the contact back at egress deadlocks,
  because a connector runs _inside_ the scope's dispatch and re-entering the scope
  actor wedges it.

  What works is the gap in the middle: a scope may never hold a _secret_ key, and
  nothing says that about a _public_ one.

  - **`sealTo` / `openSealed` in the kernel** — the asymmetric sibling of
    `SecretBox`: ECDH P-256 → AES-256-GCM, a fresh ephemeral keypair per seal, and
    an envelope that is a `SealedSecret` so it carries `keyId`. A cell that cannot
    name its key can only ever have one, and every ciphertext already written
    becomes ambiguous the day a second exists. Rotation is deferred; the envelope
    that permits it is not.
  - **A keypair per connection.** The private half is sealed under the host
    `SecretBox` beside the credential and stored **keyId-indexed from day one**,
    even holding one member — widening a column into a set later is a migration
    against live connections. Minted on first ask, so a connection older than this
    feature acquires one by being asked rather than by being reconnected.
  - **The public half is projected into the scope**, on the channel that already
    carries entitlements, identity links and connection grants — not
    `configureInstance`, because a key in the config bag becomes a key in a
    settings form.
  - **`ctx.sealToConnection(provider, plaintext)`** — awaited _before_ `ctx.emit`,
    so `emit` stays synchronous and D-28 is untouched. **Fails closed and legibly**
    when no key has reached the scope: emitting a request with its addresses
    silently dropped is the invisible failure this exists to end.
  - **`conn.unseal(cell)`** at egress, on the connection for the same reason
    `fetch` and `openAttachment` are — key material never crosses into connector
    code.

  `engine-protocol` gains `partyContact { email?, mobile? }` on
  `signatureRequestParty` and migration `0005-party-contact`, which stores **only
  the ciphertext**. There is no plaintext column to clear later and no erasure
  story to write: the address is unreadable to the spine, to its backups and to
  `sealDump`'s output, because the key that opens it is in the directory.
  `piiClass` therefore stays `'none'` — see the migration's own note for why
  `'pseudonymous'` would be actively wrong rather than more honest.

  **No `personalNumber` field, and its absence is the decision.** #687 measured the
  premise and it is false: what a provider validates is that a BankID party _has_
  the field, not that it holds a value. An optional PII field on an engine surface
  is a carrier that exists.

  Two invariants ship with the carrier, both in `requestSignatures`, both refusing
  before anything freezes:

  - **A party that will be invited must be reachable.** Otherwise the provider
    refuses after the instance has already frozen, leaving an avtal that looks sent
    for signature and is not.
  - **A set with no counterparty is refused.** "The declared primary, else the
    FIRST" is a total function, so a one-party request never failed here — it
    failed at the provider, where that party had been made the _author_, and an
    author is never invited. In production that party was the customer.

  Verified against the Scrive **testbed**, not only the mock: a party carrying an
  address no longer draws `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` at either auth level,
  and a document with one starts and reaches `pending`. The connector tolerates an
  absent contact in both skew directions — an older engine sends none, an older
  connector strips the field — so neither combination is worse than today, which is
  that nothing works.

### Patch Changes

- 954668b: Install grants an entitlement key the manifest can actually match, and a denied operation names both sides of the gap.

  **The fallback emitted an illegal key.** `installEntitlements` derives from the
  vertical's slug when nothing is declared — but a builder-pushed vertical's
  registry slug is workspace-prefixed (`t-0wv2mwk4j5/crm-eff`), while
  `manifest.entitlementKey` is `/^[a-z0-9-]+$/`. A slash is not a legal key, so
  the fallback produced a value the thing it claims to derive from can never
  equal: for a pushed vertical the granted and required keys could not agree, by
  construction. The gate reads `manifest.entitlementKey` directly, so every gated
  operation denied. The fallback now takes the slug's bare last segment, which
  repairs already-pushed verticals on their next install without a re-push.

  The mismatch was invisible until it wasn't. An un-projected scope trusts
  upstream; the flip to strict enforcement is one-way and fires on the _first_
  projection carrying entitlements — a fan-out, a reconcile, a re-provision. So a
  bad key planted at install detonates arbitrarily later, triggered by something
  unrelated to installing. That is what made the 2026-08-15 Egeryds prod lockout
  read as a sudden platform failure rather than a four-month-old typo.

  **The denial now names required AND held keys**, expired ones marked, via a
  shared `entitlementDenial()` in the kernel so the three gates (coordinator,
  scope DO, SQLite adapter) cannot word it differently. Required-alone reads as
  "buy the SKU" and sends an operator shopping; the Egeryds tenant _held_ four
  keys, just under names the manifest could never match, and required-vs-held
  shows that near-miss at a glance. Marking expiry separates "you had it, it
  lapsed" from "you never had it" — different fixes. The extra read happens only
  on the failure path; the hot path is unchanged.

  Not changed: a required key going ungranted still does not fail the install. A
  composed engine's key being absent is a legitimate SKU gate — a tenant on
  workorder but not absence is a valid state — and the platform cannot tell that
  apart from the vertical's own key being missing.

  A vertical whose `entitlementKey` diverges from its slug must still declare
  `substrat.entitlements` in package.json; the manifest never reaches the control
  plane, so no derivation can guess it. That escape hatch is now documented in
  marketplace-publish.md, along with the fact that every engine a vertical
  composes adds a key.

- c19e371: fix: a connector failure is readable, and a refused request is no longer retried for two days

  The console's card for a broken Scrive connection said, in full: `Error · scrive · Last error 7m
ago: HTTP 409 from scrive`. The real message was nine words longer and contained the whole
  answer — `Authentication to sign for participant #1 requires valid personal number field`. It
  was journaled correctly by `settlePlatformRequest` and retained; it was simply not reachable
  from anywhere a builder would look. Getting at it meant the read-only SQL console with system
  tables toggled on, or a break-glass `scope pull --full`.

  It cost a production tenant a fortnight. Three signature requests, none of which ever reached a
  counterparty: two `failed` after **100 attempts over two days**, one still `pending` at 78 and
  counting — all on the same permanent client error. The contracts sat in `pending_signature`
  throughout, and the app had nothing to tell the user.

  - **The intent journal is readable.** `_substrat_platform_requests` had one reader,
    `listPlatformRequests`, which returns only `pending` rows — so a _settled_ intent, the only
    kind that holds an answer, was invisible by construction. Its complement,
    `ScopeHost.listPlatformRequestHistory` (`kind` / `status` / `limit`, newest first), is served
    through the vertical's `/internal` surface and the control plane's new
    `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/intents`, and rendered in the dashboard's integration detail as
    "Delivery attempts": id, status, attempts, timings, what was sent, and `lastError`
    **verbatim** — truncating it would rebuild the exact wall the section exists to remove.
  - **A 4xx settles terminal on the first attempt.** `pending` means _try again_, and every throw
    got it by default: right for a provider outage, wrong for a provider's refusal. A 4xx is the
    provider telling the caller its request is wrong; attempt 101 sends the identical bytes.
    `isTerminalProviderError` classifies structurally on the error's `status`, so no host imports
    a connector's error class — and 5xx, 408, 423, 425, 429 and anything with no status stay
    retryable, because a failure you cannot classify must never be settled terminally. Two days of
    silent retries becomes one settled row with the provider's own sentence on it.
  - **A terminal settle is visible to an operator.** It now lands an ops-failure row
    (`stage: 'terminal'`), the same treatment the attempt ceiling already had. A give-up and a
    refusal end the same way — nobody is coming back to the intent — so they deserve the same
    headline.
  - **A vertical can read the outcome of its own intents.** `ctx.platformRequests(filter)` is the
    read half of `ctx.requestPlatform`, which had none: an app could ask the platform to do
    something and then had no supported way to learn whether it happened. This is what lets a
    contract screen say the signing request never left, instead of showing a document that appears
    to be out for signature and is not. Read-only by construction — the kernel owns every write to
    that table.

  `ScopeHost` gained `listPlatformRequestHistory` and `OperationContext` gained
  `platformRequests`; both in-tree adapters implement them and the contract-test suite holds them.
  The 409 itself is a connector/engine gap, filed separately.

- daab0d5: feat(control-plane): the connection relay — a tenant admin connects a provider from the vertical's own UI

  `POST /internal/connections/upsert` (connections.md §3.5.2), mirroring the email relay
  (#303): a hosted CP-less vertical permission-checks the act with its own `ctx.check`,
  returns the pasted credential as a harness-side effect, and the harness POSTs it to the
  control plane, which re-derives the vertical from its own scope record (the shared
  `PLATFORM_SECRET` never says which vertical), seals the secret with the platform's
  `SecretBox`, and applies any requested `grantToConnection` grants on the calling scope.
  Upserts are keyed (tenant, vertical, provider, externalAccountRef): a live connection is
  rotated **in place**, so the connection id — and every grant tuple keyed on it — survives
  rotation, making credential rotation self-serve. Attribution follows §3.5.1 on both paths:
  `createdBy` on create, and a new additive `opts.rotatedBy` on
  `HostAdmin.updateConnectionSecret` that lands in the audit metadata on rotate — the tenant
  principal, never laundered into the platform actor. New contracts:
  `connectionRelayRequest` / `connectionRelayResult`; new export
  `relayConnectionUpsert` from `@substrat-run/control-plane-api`.

- 778f48a: Connection grants now reach scopes provisioned after the grant (#592). `grantToConnection` records each grant directory-side alongside the enforcement tuple (`_substrat_connection_grants`, tombstoned by `revokeConnection`'s cascade, readable via `HostAdmin.listConnectionGrants` and `GET /tenants/:tenantId/connection-grants`), and provision/reconcile gather those rows and deliver them per scope — the same authoritative channel as entitlements (#310) and identity links (#406) — so the connector return path works on every install without a human replaying grants, and a revoked connection's grants stop being delivered.

- c1faa15: feat: every pushed version records where its code came from — git CI or a terminal

  A git-connected deploy and a `substrat push` from a terminal were
  indistinguishable on the platform: the generated deploy workflow runs the same
  CLI against the same endpoint, so the dashboard could not answer "where did the
  code this app is serving come from". Now the CLI self-reports its context with
  each push and the dashboard shows it:

  - **Contracts**: `versionOrigin` on the version record — `source: 'git' | 'cli'`
    plus `gitRepo`/`gitCommit`/`gitRef` when pushed from CI. A label, never
    authority: nothing gates on it, and a version pushed before tracking (or by an
    old CLI) reads back `null`.
  - **CLI**: `substrat push` detects the GitHub Actions runner and attaches the
    repo, commit, and branch it built from; a terminal push sends `{ source: 'cli' }`.
  - **Control plane**: the deploy route parses the field leniently — a missing or
    malformed origin must never fail a push — and both adapters store it as a
    nullable `origin_json` column on the version row.
  - **Dashboard**: an origin tag (git-branch icon + `repo@sha` linking to the
    GitHub commit, or a terminal icon + `cli`) on every version row on the
    Verticals page, in the per-app Deployments tab, and beside the app's Running
    version.

  The vertical-level `source` field is deliberately untouched: it is
  claim-at-first-push metadata, and one app legitimately receives both kinds of
  push — provenance is per version.

- b387919: feat(platform): operational failures get a durable, queryable record (#559 step 3)

  A failed deploy, install, or preview restore left no durable trace — the admin log
  audits successful mutations only (by design: it answers "who changed what", and a
  failure changed nothing), so the 2026-08-08 preview-restore incident was diagnosable
  solely from a vertical script's short-retention observability logs.

  `HostAdmin` gains `recordOpsFailure` / `listOpsFailures` over a new
  `_substrat_ops_failures` directory table (both adapters, contract-tested): actor,
  operation, stage, tenant/scope/vertical, answered status, bounded message, and the
  upstream provider's trace reference (Cloudflare's `internal error; reference = <id>`)
  extracted into its own searchable column. Retention-bounded telemetry, not evidence:
  rows self-prune on write after `OPS_FAILURE_RETENTION_DAYS` (90), so the table needs
  no cron and can never grow without bound.

  The control-plane transport records from three places — the error boundary (any
  answered 5xx except 501, including a downstream vertical's 502 passthrough), the
  deploy-upload catch (both the 502 platform-failure and the 422 bad-bundle, for the
  coming builder-facing view), and the install-provision catch after its retry is
  exhausted — and serves `GET /ops-failures` (staff-only, paged, filterable by
  vertical/tenant/operation/reference, newest first).

- fa81319: feat(platform): a data subject can finally be erased, and the backups cannot un-erase them (#37)

  `piiClass: none|pseudonymous|direct` has been enforced at the type level since the contracts
  package existed: an event that could carry PII cannot be declared without a `subjectId`, and
  the Zod message says why — _"crypto-shredding must be able to key the erasure"_. The
  classification was total by construction. The erasure it keys did not exist anywhere in
  `packages/`. `demos/hr` seeds real-shaped national IDs against a comment promising a
  mechanism nobody had built.

  **The mechanism divides the way the stores divide, not the way the data does.**

  _Tier 1 is mutable, so erasing there is redaction._ `shredSubject` nulls the payload of
  every classified spine row keyed to the subject and keeps the envelope — id, type, entity,
  `occurredAt`, and the pseudonymous `subjectId`. That is master-plan §5.3 held exactly:
  _"pseudonymous keys and transaction facts remain"_. A timeline still shows that something
  happened, to what, and when. It no longer shows who, or what was said. No cryptography is
  involved and none is wanted: sealing a live payload would break the raw-SQL timeline
  projections CLAUDE.md explicitly blesses.

  _A platform-retained copy is not mutable, so erasing there is cryptographic._ A reap backup
  is full-fidelity on purpose — _"a backup that cannot restore is a false promise"_ — which is
  precisely why `UPDATE … SET payload = NULL` can never reach one. Each subject's payloads are
  now sealed under their own key on the way into a stored copy (`sealDump`, the sibling of
  `maskDump` and the opposite discipline: lossless and keyed rather than lossy and heuristic).
  Destroying that one key reaches backwards into every copy already taken, and leaves every
  other subject in the same copy restorable.

  **Where the keys live is the guarantee, not an implementation detail.** Per-subject DEKs sit
  in the **directory**, wrapped by the host `SecretBox`, never in the scope database whose rows
  they protect — master-plan.md:316, _"GDPR erasure claims are only as credible as the key
  store's independence"_. A key restored by the same dump that restores its ciphertext would
  silently reverse every erasure the restore rolled past.

  **The tombstone is what makes it an erasure rather than a delay.** A shred keeps the key row
  with the key cleared, and the sealer refuses tombstoned subjects. Without that, the next
  backup mints a fresh key and quietly undoes the erasure — a key store that forgets who was
  erased can erase them exactly once.

  **Order inside the action is fixed: redact the live spine first, destroy the key last.** Both
  halves are idempotent and a crash between them converges on retry, so the tiebreak is which
  half-done state harms the person — a run that died after redacting leaves ciphertext nobody
  can open; destroying the key first would leave their PII in the live database while the audit
  log already claimed they were erased.

  New on `HostAdmin`, implemented by **both** adapters with the crypto factored into the kernel
  (`createSubjectKeys`) so an adapter supplies three row operations and no cipher:
  `shredSubject`, `sealSubjectPayloads`, `openSubjectPayloads`. New `shredSubject` admin action,
  carrying a receipt (`eventsRedacted`, `keyDestroyed`, `tombstoned`) as its `after`. Audited in
  **both** logs — the admin log because it is a mutation, the access log because it destroys
  evidence, and an erasure is the one action where _who asked for this to disappear_ is itself
  part of the record.

  `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/subjects/:id/shred` is staff-only and absent from
  `BUILDER_ROUTES`: a builder forwards the DSAR and the platform executes it, which is where
  hosting-and-certification.md §3 already draws the line (_"we provide extraction, they define
  scope"_).

  **Five limits ship as documentation, not as backlog** (kernel-design §13.1, closing open
  question 17's spine half). One subject per event, so _"erase Jens Palmgren from everywhere"_
  is still out of reach. Vertical-owned tables are untouched — `hr_employees.national_id` needs
  the `onSubjectErased` hook that is deliberately a separate issue. Copies already handed to a
  customer, and backups taken before sealing existed, are beyond reach. A PITR rewind restores
  the pre-redaction state. A directory restore can resurrect a key, and the admin log — the
  compliance witness, never swept — is what records which erasures must then be re-applied.

  The acceptance criterion is a round trip rather than a claim: back up a scope, shred one of
  its two subjects, read the same stored copy back, and watch that subject's payloads open to
  nothing while the other's restore intact.

### Patch Changes

- 6ecb3c9: feat(platform): the stored copies get a lifecycle, and only an operator can start the clock (#557)

  The backup buckets kept every copy forever: `scopes/` reap copies (#493) and `access-log/`
  NDJSON batches (#553) had no lifecycle rule — the one retention decision #36's closure left
  unmade. (`directory/` copies were never the gap; their 30-copy window has lived in
  `backupDirectoryIfDue` since #40.)

  **`pruneScopeBackups` / `pruneAccessLogBatches`** (control-plane-api) enforce an age window
  over their own prefix, in code rather than as an R2 bucket rule so the policy is visible in
  the repo and portable to any store. Both are conservative by construction: an object that
  cannot be dated is kept, and an access-log batch is dated by its **newest** row — never
  dropped while it still holds in-window rows. The CP worker's sweep runs them behind two new
  opt-in vars, `SCOPE_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` and `ACCESS_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`; unset — the
  default — deletes nothing, the same posture as the reap windows: the platform never deletes
  evidence on a schedule a human did not choose.

  **The drive-by #553 flagged:** `pruneAccessLog`'s admin-log row carried its payload in
  `before`, inverted from `adminLogEntry`'s contract (before = prior state, after = the
  applied payload). Both adapters now record `after: { pruned }`, matching `drainAccessLog`,
  and the contract suite pins the shape.

### Minor Changes

- 88e2efa: fix(control-plane): a push stops reading the whole fleet to warn about its own surfaces

  A `substrat push` answered `500: internal error` **after** its version had already been
  published — the bundle uploaded, the version landed admitted, and only then did the
  request die. Each CI retry burned another version label and left another admitted version
  behind for a deploy that reported failure, so a PR's three attempts produced `…-pr-30.1`,
  `.2` and `.3` and no working preview.

  The throw was in the advisory surface-drift check, which is the last thing a deploy does.
  It asked for **every hostname binding on the platform** and filtered to the pushed slug in
  JS. Two things were wrong with that, and only together do they make an outage:

  `mapHostname` read the stored cert-validation records with a bare `JSON.parse`. That column
  is the one part of a hostname row this platform does not write — it is whatever the
  Cloudflare custom-hostname API returned, stored verbatim — so an unreadable blob there is a
  `SyntaxError`, which is not a `ZodError`, which `mapError` does not recognise, which is a
  blank 500. Because the read was fleet-wide, a cert detail belonging to one tenant's custom
  domain could stop an unrelated vertical from shipping, with nothing in the response saying
  so.

  So: **narrow the query, and never throw on that column.** `listHostnames` takes a
  `verticalSlug` filter, implemented in SQL by both adapters, and the deploy path asks for the
  bindings it actually wants — the rows that answer the question are now the only rows that
  can break it. `parseValidationRecords` (kernel, shared by both adapters so neither can be
  the lenient one) degrades a malformed or wrong-shaped blob to "no records". Nothing routes
  on those records; they are a copy-this-CNAME hint, and `substrat hostnames verify` re-polls
  issuance and rewrites them.

  **And the read that was never the right shape.** "The version with this id" was spelled as
  an unpaginated `listVersions(slug)` followed by `.find()` — every version a vertical ever
  published, each carrying its stored manifest, pulled across the adapter boundary to keep
  one. That cost grows once per push and lands hardest on the paths least able to afford it:
  the deploy handler's own read-back, and the router's per-request resolution of which script
  serves a scope. New `HostAdmin.getVersion(actor, versionId, verticalSlug?)`, implemented by
  both adapters, replaces nine such call sites. The optional slug preserves what
  `.find()`-inside-one-slug's-list gave for free — a version of another vertical reads as
  absent rather than being handed back across the lineage boundary.

  The retries remain non-idempotent: a push that fails after `publishVersion` still consumes
  its version label. Left alone here because making a push resumable is a design change, not
  a fix, and it is no longer reachable by this route.

- f278cc6: fix(previews): route a preview to its bound version, not the prod serving script (#527)

  A preview reported success and printed a URL that then served the promoted **prod**
  build, not the version it just pushed — so a reviewer saw their change missing and
  concluded it hadn't landed. Root cause: every scope inherited the vertical's stable
  `serving_ref` at provision (#286), and routing resolves
  `COALESCE(scope.serving_ref, version.deployment_ref)`, so a preview resolved to the
  prod serving script instead of the per-version dispatch script its data was restored
  into. Preview scopes now skip that inheritance (both adapters), so routing falls through
  to the bound version's script. Reused previews created before this fix self-heal (the
  stale `serving_ref` is cleared on re-push). Defense-in-depth: `orchestratedPreview` now
  refuses to report success for a preview that would route away from its bound version.

### Minor Changes

- 3fcf34b: Give hosted verticals a sanctioned way to send transactional mail — the resolution of the
  outbound-policy open question (#303). The sandbox deliberately keeps `send_email` off the §4
  allowlist (and a Workers-for-Platforms dispatch script cannot bind it anyway), so a vertical
  never sends directly: it POSTs to the control plane's new `POST /internal/email/send` **relay**,
  which sends on its behalf — but only if that vertical holds the staff-granted `emailSender`
  capability. The `from` address is always the platform's onboarded sender.

  The capability mirrors `tenantProvisioner` exactly, as three parts:

  - a manifest **request** — `package.json` `substrat.sendsEmail`, carried on push into the
    registry as `sendsEmail`, refreshed on every push and granting nothing by itself;
  - a registry **grant** — `emailSender`, a directory flag a push can never set or keep, flipped
    by the new staff op `setVerticalEmailSender` (and the console's "Grant email sender" toggle);
  - a platform-held **relay** — `PlatformRelayEmailTransport` (another `EmailTransport`
    implementation) on the vertical side, and the control-plane endpoint on the other, which
    re-derives _which_ vertical is calling from the named `(tenant, scope)` and checks the grant
    against that. Holding the shared `PLATFORM_SECRET` (injected into every dispatch script, and
    the relay's auth) is not enough. The control plane's own origin is injected into every vertical
    as `CONTROL_PLANE_URL` so it knows where to POST.

  `HostAdmin` gains `setVerticalEmailSender`; both adapters persist a nullable `email_sender`
  directory column (a directory schema change, not a module migration). The auth-server demo
  declares `sendsEmail` and uses the relay transport when hosted, so its Better-Auth
  `sendResetPassword` flow finally delivers on a dispatch install. Everything is additive — every
  existing manifest, registry row, and `HostAdmin` call site keeps compiling.

### Patch Changes

- 3246681: Guard `reapScope` so a still-serving scope can never be reaped. A serving app
  always holds ≥1 bound hostname, so `reapScope` now refuses (fail closed) while
  any hostname is bound to the scope — unbind first, a visible and reversible step.

  The hole this closes: `reapScope` _assumed_ "hostnames were released at archive",
  which is true for the dashboard delete path (it unbinds) but not for a bare
  console `archiveScope` (a status flip only). An archived-but-still-bound scope
  walked straight into the irreversible wipe, taking a live app's storage with it.

  The guard is enforced in two places — the host adapter (so the contract suite
  asserts it for every adapter) and the per-scope reap route, ahead of the
  vertical's `deleteScope` where the production wipe actually happens. `HostAdmin.reapScope`
  gains an optional `{ force?: boolean }`: deliberate teardown (tenant reap §4.8,
  retention sweeps §4.4) releases every name by design and sets `force: true`; the
  interactive per-scope reap never does.

### Minor Changes

- d222905: Platform blob store + attachment surface (#473): `attachmentTargets`, declared by
  the contract and every engine but implemented by nothing, now has a runtime home.

  - **A fourth store shape.** `blobStoreNeed` in `runtimeNeeds.blobStores` — the
    `tenantStoreNeed` sibling for attachment bytes: the platform mints one bucket per
    tenant (R2 on `adapter-cloudflare`, a per-tenant directory on the pure adapter), the
    builder declares no id, so it is a _need_ the platform provisions, never an `r2_bucket`
    binding the bundle carries. Seams: `ScopeHost.provisionBlobStore` / `listBlobStores`,
    a `blob_stores` ledger in both adapters, and the `createR2BlobStores` REST client.
  - **`attachmentTargets` consumed.** `ScopeHost.attachments(principal, tenant, scope)`
    gates every read by the declared target's `readPermission` and every mutation by its
    new optional `writePermission` (default: the read key) — proof path included,
    per-entity, evaluated where `ctx.check` is. The read gate no longer leaves `ctx` for a
    hand-rolled route handler.
  - **Rows in the scope, bytes in the store.** The metadata fact lands in a new
    `_substrat_attachments` table inside the scope database (so `scope pull` / restore /
    PITR carry it), transactional with an `attachment.added` / `attachment.removed` spine
    event. Bytes go straight to the per-tenant store, never through the scope's
    structured-clone invoke pipe. Keys are platform-derived (`scope/<scopeId>/att/<id>`),
    so per-scope isolation inside a per-tenant store is construction, not convention.
  - **Integrity across the split.** Bytes are SHA-256'd at upload and written once under a
    fresh ULID key, so a row can never point at bytes other than the ones it was born with;
    a PITR rewind can at worst orphan an object (GC-able), never re-point a row.
  - **Deploy path.** The WfP bindings patcher and every in-place serving upload now
    re-derive `r2_bucket` bindings from the blob-store ledger alongside the D1 tenant-store
    bindings (`blobStoreBindingName(binding, tenantId)`), so a re-deploy is structurally
    unable to drop a tenant's attachment bucket. The CLI carries `blobStores` from
    `runtimeNeeds` into the deploy manifest, admitted as a need (never a binding).

### Patch Changes

- e9c7bd0: `deleteVertical`'s bound-scope refusal no longer counts `reaped` tombstones —
  they are terminal history, and counting them made any vertical that ever had an
  install permanently undeletable. An `archived` scope (a deleted app) still
  blocks, since unarchive can restore it, but the refusal now names the actual
  remaining step ("reap or restore them first") instead of telling the caller to
  delete an app that is already gone. Contract-tested in both adapters.

### Minor Changes

- d96269e: Adapters report committed platform intents to the stub minter (#458). `getScope` accepts `ScopeStubOptions` with an `onPlatformRequests(count)` observer, fired after an invoke commits having enqueued `ctx.requestPlatform` intents — never on rollback. A vertical wires it once in its stub helper to flag responses `x-substrat-platform-request` (new kernel constant `PLATFORM_REQUEST_HEADER`), so the router kick (#381) drains provisioning in seconds without per-route hand-wiring.
- 3c77f64: Connections become multi-account per provider — the Vercel "Git namespace" shape. Live-uniqueness widens from (tenant, vertical, provider) to (tenant, vertical, provider, account), where the account leg is `COALESCE(external_account_ref, '')`, so providers that never set an account ref keep their singleton semantics while a tenant can now hold one GitHub connection per org/user. `openConnection` gains an optional `externalAccountRef` selector (omitted with several accounts live it throws rather than picking one arbitrarily), `connectionFilter` gains `externalAccountRef`, and both adapters migrate the old `_substrat_connections_live` index in place (`DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` + the new `_substrat_connections_live_account`). The dashboard's git-import flow connects additional GitHub accounts without severing the first, lists repos per selected namespace, and threads the account through branches + one-click CI setup.
- d59a515: Every list read pages the same way: the admin-log cursor convention, generalized.
  `@substrat-run/contracts` gains `pagination.ts` (`listPageQuery` — limit default 20,
  max 200 — `ListPage`, `Page<T>`, `pageOf`); every `HostAdmin.list*` takes an optional
  keyset page (unset stays unbounded for in-process callers); both adapters implement
  the keyset SQL and the contract suite proves it. **Wire change:** every control-plane
  GET list route (`/tenants`, `/scopes`, `/verticals`, `/verticals/:slug/versions`,
  `/channels`, `/channels/:channel/history`, `/hostnames`, `/roles`, `/admin-log`) now
  returns `{ entries, nextCursor }` and defaults a 20-row page — older CLI versions
  parse these as bare arrays and must upgrade; this CLI walks the cursor wherever it
  needs the complete list.

### Patch Changes

- 3a0eaa4: Declared schedules run on a CP-less host (#461). `provisionScopeLocal` now projects each registered module's `system:<moduleId>` schedule grants (#383) into the scope's tuples, in the same atomic projection unit as the owner grant — without them the grant-is-the-switch check reported `fired: 0` forever, indistinguishable from "nothing due". And `runDueSchedules` skips the control-plane liveness read on a CP-less host, which has no directory to ask and already trusts the router-asserted (tenant, scope). `scheduleMod` is now exported from contract-tests for adapter-level CP-less coverage.

### Minor Changes

- 3cf4e3b: The provisioner capability gains its request half (#455): a manager vertical DECLARES the
  target verticals it provisions — package.json `substrat.provisions`, carried on push to
  the registry row (`vertical.provisions`, riding the refreshable install*spec bag) — and
  the console reviews the declaration like a publish request (declared-but-ungranted shows
  as \_provisioner requested*; the grant button reads _Approve provisioner_). Declaration is
  a request, never a grant: `tenantProvisioner` stays the staff-flipped flag a push cannot
  touch (contract-tested both ways). The drain's `admitManager` now distinguishes
  _undeclared_ (fix your manifest) from _declared-but-ungranted_ (awaiting staff) in its
  refusal, and — #412 invariant 4 — bounds a granted manager's `provision-tenant` to its
  declared targets, phased: a granted manager that declares nothing keeps its pre-#455
  unbounded behavior until its next push declares.

- 5afb162: The tenant-provisioner capability becomes a directory-backed staff grant (#444, #412).
  `vertical.tenantProvisioner` is a registry flag flipped by the new audited
  `setVerticalTenantProvisioner` admin action (console: Grant/Revoke provisioner, route
  `POST /verticals/:slug/tenant-provisioner`, staff-only) and read by the drain's
  `admitManager` at execution time — replacing the `TENANT_PROVISIONERS` env list, which
  was configured nowhere and would have put customer slugs in deployment config. Never set
  at registration and never touched by a re-push refresh (contract-tested): pushing code is
  never how a vertical acquires or keeps platform authority. BREAKING for
  `control-plane-api` consumers: `ManagedTenantDeps.provisioners` is gone — the grant
  lives on the registry row.

### Minor Changes

- 070f4dc: A vertical can schedule its own recurring work (#383)

  A vertical can now declare `schedules` in its module manifest — operations the platform
  invokes on every live scope of it, on a cadence, driven by the existing platform sweep. It
  is the seam a domain rule triggered by the passage of time (a contract that activates on its
  start date, a leave that can no longer be approved once it has already begun) had no way to
  reach: the operation was written, idempotent, and paged, but nothing woke it up on a date.

  The work is attributed honestly. Rather than the out-of-band workaround of signing in as a
  human and running under their permission — the attribution laundering #97 refused — a
  schedule runs under a **system principal**, the third caller #97 named, built the same way it
  built the connector seam:

  - a new `{ kind: 'system', id: ModuleId }` check-subject, mirror of the connection subject;
  - `ScopeHost.getSystemScope(moduleId, tenantId, scopeId)` — a door whose stub stamps
    `{ system: moduleId }` on events and resolves `system:<moduleId>` grants;
  - `HostAdmin.grantToSystem(...)` — the scheduler analogue of `grantToConnection`, projected
    from a schedule's declared `permissions` at provisioning, so `ctx.check` stays the single
    gate and the grant appears in the reviewed permission diff. Revoking it disables the
    schedule for one tenant, no special flag.

  `runPlatformSweep` gains a schedules phase (`registeredSchedules` / `runDueSchedules`) that
  enumerates each vertical's live scopes and fires due operations under bounded concurrency,
  skipping forks and any scope that does not hold the grant, recording per-scope outcomes in
  `PlatformSweepReport.schedules`. All additive: a manifest that declares no schedules, and a
  host predating the seam, behave exactly as before.

### Patch Changes

- 50d9260: Platform intents, Phase B1: the drain surface (read + settle).

  Adds the read/settle half of the platform-intent queue from `docs/design/platform-intents.md`, so
  the platform can pull a scope's pending intents and journal their outcome. `ScopeHost` gains
  `listPlatformRequests(tenantId, scopeId)` (pending intents, mapped to the `PlatformRequest`
  contract shape) and `settlePlatformRequest(tenantId, scopeId, id, { status, result, lastError })`
  (mark `done` / `failed` / `pending`-for-retry). Both are fleet-maintenance (no actor), the same
  class as `drainDue`, implemented symmetrically in both adapters (a `pendingPlatformRequests` /
  `settlePlatformRequest` DO RPC pair on the Cloudflare scope DO; direct table reads/writes on the
  SQLite adapter).

  `result` is COALESCE'd on settle, so a value written on an earlier pass (e.g. a minted sibling
  scope id for two-phase idempotency) survives an omitted one on retry. Contract-suite coverage on
  both adapters: list-pending → settle-done → drops from pending with its result recorded, and a
  transient `pending` retry preserves the two-phase result.

  No cross-deployment execution yet — the `VerticalClient` `/internal/platform-requests` transport,
  the kind→handler drain engine, `provision-sibling`, and the sweep wiring are Phase B2 (#358). The
  key constraint driving that split: the control plane can't read a vertical's scope DO directly
  (different deployments — the reason the CP sweep runs `drainRetries: false`), so B2 drains over the
  vertical's `/internal/*` HTTP surface, exactly like Data-tab introspection.

### Patch Changes

- 67be7c7: Platform intents, Phase A: the `ctx.requestPlatform` primitive.

  Adds the foundation from `docs/design/platform-intents.md` — the sandbox-clean way a vertical
  asks the platform for a privileged action (provision a sibling scope, quota, …) without an
  upward call. A vertical operation calls `ctx.requestPlatform({ kind, payload })` after its own
  permission check; the kernel durably records a typed intent in this scope's new
  `_substrat_platform_requests` spine table (atomic with the operation, stamped with the actor), and
  returns the request id. The platform will pull and execute these with `HostAdmin` authority in a
  later phase — knowing the tenant inherently because it reads that scope's own DO.

  - `OperationContext` gains `requestPlatform(input): PlatformRequestId` (kernel), implemented
    symmetrically in both adapters; `contracts` gains `platformRequestId`, `platformRequestInput` /
    `platformRequest` schemas, and the `MAX_PENDING_PLATFORM_REQUESTS` backpressure bound (the verb
    refuses once a scope holds that many pending intents).
  - **Migration checkpoint:** a new `_substrat_platform_requests` spine table is added to each
    adapter's `KERNEL_DDL` (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it back-fills existing scopes on next
    open). No versioned module migration; it is kernel spine, flagged `system` automatically.
  - Contract-suite coverage (both adapters): the intent is enqueued as `pending` with its kind /
    payload / actor, and rolls back with its operation when the handler throws (K-4).

  No consumer yet — the drain-executor, router kick, and the Manyfold "New site" flow are later
  phases (#358).

### Minor Changes

- e612b98: Reap archived scopes (§4.4): free the Durable Object storage that Cloudflare never
  garbage-collects. Deleting an app archives its scope — a tombstone-only transition that
  keeps the directory row but leaves the scope DO holding every byte forever. This adds a
  terminal `reaped` state past `archived`: `reapScope` wipes the DO's storage while keeping
  the directory row (audit history + burned slug), the one irreversible scope transition, so
  it only ever leaves `archived`, `getScope` fails closed on it, and its slug is released for
  reuse. Delivered two ways over one seam — the storage wipe reaches the vertical's own
  deployment (a hosted scope's DO is CP-less) via the same `deleteScope` dispatch the snapshot
  GC uses: a staff-only `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/reap` (armed in the console behind a
  type-the-slug dialog, since there is no restore), and a `runPlatformSweep` phase that reaps
  scopes archived longer than `SCOPE_RETENTION_DAYS` — opt-in and unset by default, because
  the reap cannot be undone. Both adapters gain an additive `archived_at` column (stamped on
  archive, cleared on unarchive) to age the sweep, and their `(tenant_id, slug)` unique index
  becomes partial on the live statuses so a retained tombstone never blocks the slug reuse the
  pre-check already intends — closing a latent gap where archived slugs could not actually be
  reclaimed.
- caedb1c: A prod promote no longer strands a legacy scope's data, and the in-place serve is honest and
  complete end-to-end (#321). #287 shipped the serve-in-place, but existing (pre-#286) scopes were
  never migrated onto the stable serving script, so every promote re-stranded them: the private-
  vertical rebind cascade advanced a legacy scope's version to the incoming version's fresh,
  empty per-version dispatch script, `0001-init` re-ran against empty storage, and the app rendered
  a no-access page that read as an auth bug rather than data loss.

  - **Adopt-before-rebind on promote.** For a dispatch-backed vertical, the host rebind cascade is
    skipped (an embedded vertical, with no per-version script, keeps it) and the control-plane-api
    prod-promote handler owns adopt-then-rebind in the correct order: after a successful in-place
    serve, each still-legacy owned scope is adopted onto the stable serving script — its bytes moved
    off the per-version script _before_ any version pointer advances — then rebound. Retry-safe:
    nothing rebinds until the adopt succeeds, so a failed serve strands nothing and a re-promote
    resumes. A shared `adoptScopeOntoServing` primitive backs both this and the explicit endpoint.

  - **A builder-triggerable backfill for existing installs.** `substrat scope adopt-serving <scopeId>`
    migrates one legacy scope; `--vertical <slug>` (and `POST /verticals/:slug/adopt-serving`)
    backfills every still-legacy scope of a vertical. Idempotent.

  - **`scope restore` accepts an adapter-sqlite scope file and errors actionably.** `importDump`/
    `loadDump` re-assert the kernel spine after the drop-then-replay, so a dump that omits
    `_substrat_roles`/`_substrat_tenant_tuples` (an adapter-sqlite scope file keeps them in its
    directory db) no longer leaves the target missing spine tables and crashing a later check with a
    bare `no such table` → the detail-less `internal error` the field report hit. The restore route
    returns an actionable 422 instead of the generic 500.

  - **A failed in-place serve stops reading as "deployed."** `servingVersionId` is added to the
    channel surface (`VerticalChannel` + both adapters' `listChannels`): a prod promote moves the
    channel pointer before the serve, so when the serve fails `servingVersionId !== versionId` is the
    honest signal that the scopes still run the previous code. `substrat versions`, the dashboard
    deployments view, and the console surface the divergence and prompt a re-promote.

  - **An empty role projection is a platform condition, not only a per-app 403.** A new
    `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/health` reports `roleProjectionEmpty` for an active scope whose served
    DO has zero projected roles (the silent state the field report chased through a migration-journal
    diff); the console Scopes detail raises it as a flagged condition.

  Prevents future stranding and gives a migration path for existing installs. Recovering data already
  stranded by an earlier bad promote (locating the specific prior per-version script) is a separate
  ops task, out of scope here.

- f0df69a: Tenant delete with a grace window (§4.8, #36): reclaim a deleted tenant's data instead of
  stranding it forever. `deleting` was a dead status — written once (a dashboard team-delete)
  and never consumed, so a tenant marked for deletion kept every byte. This finishes the
  lifecycle as the tenant analogue of §4.4's scope reap.

  `tenantStatus` gains a terminal `reaped` past `deleting`, and the `tenants` row gains a
  `deletingAt` timestamp (stamped on entering `deleting`, cleared on un-delete) so the grace
  window can be aged. `deleting` stays a reversible pause — every scope already fails `getScope`
  closed under a non-active tenant, so nothing is destroyed until a reap, and an un-delete (→
  `active`) restores the tenant whole. `reapTenant` (new on `HostAdmin`, directory-side only)
  clears the tenant's PII/config directory rows — identities and identity pools, membership
  tuples, roles, entitlements, orgs — and flips the row to a `reaped` tombstone, keeping the
  `tenants` row (burned slug + history) and `_substrat_admin_log` whole. It refuses any tenant
  not in `deleting`; `reaped` is unreachable via `setTenantStatus`.

  Delivered over one seam, two ways: a staff-only `POST /tenants/:t/reap` ("reap now", armed in
  the console behind a type-the-slug dialog, refused with 409 unless the tenant is `deleting`),
  and a `runPlatformSweep` phase that reaps tenants whose `deletingAt` is older than
  `TENANT_RETENTION_DAYS` — opt-in and unset by default, because the reap is irreversible. The
  per-scope byte-wipe runs above the kernel: the reaper archives-if-needed then reaps each scope
  through the existing `reapScopeFn` seam (so the control plane's orchestrated per-scope wipe
  applies for free), then clears the directory via `reapTenant`.

  Also settles #36's retention question: the admin log is the compliance witness (bokföringslagen
  §5.3) and is deliberately **never swept** — no TTL. The bound against dumping an ever-growing
  table lives on the read surface instead: `GET /admin-log` now defaults a page size (the
  in-process `auditLog` stays unbounded, so an internal caller that wants everything still gets it,
  and `nextCursor` walks the whole log).

  Full-tenant export (GDPR Art. 20 portability) is intentionally out of scope here — the per-scope
  `exportScope` seam it builds on already exists.

### Minor Changes

- 72b1128: Entitlements express a plan (#33): the two-column SKU flag grows `expiresAt`,
  `quota`, `plan` and `grantedAt`/`grantedBy`. Expiry is the one field the kernel
  itself enforces — an expired grant fails closed at the per-invoke gate exactly as
  if revoked, checked lazily at read like tuple expiry (never swept), and the row
  stays in `listEntitlements` so a lapsed trial reads as lapsed rather than
  never-granted. Quota and tier are expression only, per the D-33 reframe: they
  describe the builder's subscription, and counting usage against them is the
  builder portal's job — which is why plan _expression_ lands ahead of billing
  (#39 stays blocked on meters). Grant calls are PATCH-shaped: omitted fields
  preserve what the row carries (a bare re-grant on an idempotent provisioning
  path cannot silently turn a trial perpetual), explicit null clears, and any
  effective change is a renewal audited with before/after. `listEntitlements` now
  returns `EntitlementGrant[]` instead of `string[]`; the PUT route accepts the
  plan as an optional body (a bodyless PUT stays the bare-flag grant); both
  adapters widen `_substrat_entitlements` with nullable columns via the existing
  ensure-column path, so legacy rows read as perpetual boolean flags — exactly
  their old semantics. The console shows and edits the plan half; Callout's boot
  mirror forwards whole grants so the shared plane never sees a trial as
  perpetual.
- 1cfce31: A hosted vertical reads its entitlements at request time from a scope-local projection (#304),
  settling kernel open-question 5 with the same answer as the routing cache.

  Entitlements used to be a coordinator-only, trust-at-provision check: it gated _module loading_,
  but a dispatched worker could not read `plan`/`quota`/`tier` at request time — the `CONTROL_PLANE`
  binding is forbidden by the sandbox contract (#302) — and a CP-less scope short-circuited the gate
  to `true`, enforcing nothing in-request, not even expiry.

  Entitlements are now **projected into each scope** alongside roles and tenant tuples, extending the
  scope-local-permissions machinery rather than duplicating it:

  - **`OperationContext` gains `entitlement(key)` and `entitlements()`** — the sanctioned request-time
    read. Returns the live view (`key`, `plan`, `quota`, `expiresAt`) or `null`; expiry is applied at
    read, so a non-null result is always live. A hosted scope reads its local projection; a
    console-managed scope reads over the same RPC the permission checker uses. New `EntitlementView`
    contract type.
  - **The per-operation gate fails closed against the projection** on the scope-local path — expiry
    and revocation now enforce at request time in a hosted vertical, not only at provision.
  - **A grant/revoke fans out to invalidate** the projected scopes — the event-invalidation half of
    kernel open-question 5's answer (cached in scope DOs with event invalidation), deliberately the
    same project-on-write mechanism the routing/suspension cache defers to.

  Two posture calls, per #33's grain:

  - **Expose, don't enforce** `quota`/`plan`: the kernel gates presence + expiry; the vertical reads
    the number and enforces its own quota (no kernel usage-counting).
  - **Fail-closed enforcement flips per scope** via an `entitlements_enforced` marker set the first
    time entitlements are projected — a scope provisioned before #304 keeps trusting upstream until a
    fan-out / reconcile / re-provision back-fills it, so the switch to strict enforcement strands no
    live scope.

  `provisionScopeLocal` accepts an optional `entitlements` list (the platform passes the tenant's
  grants at provision). Scoped out as a follow-up: the platform→dispatched-vertical provision path
  (control-plane-api) does not yet _pass_ entitlements into `provisionScopeLocal`, so re-projection to
  a live dispatched worker rides re-provision/reconcile until that is wired; expiry still enforces
  locally meanwhile, because the projected row carries it.

- aa503c2: Record what authorized a mutation on its event, and what was refused (K-34, K-35).

  **K-34 — authorization on the event envelope.** `ctx.check` computes a `Decision` whose
  allow branch carries the proof chain, and the kernel discarded it — so a mutation-event
  recorded who acted but never under what authority. `DomainEvent` gains an optional,
  kernel-stamped `authorization: {permission, grant?}[]`: the checks the emitting operation
  passed, plus — when the allow came via a capability grant rather than a role — the granting
  tuple's `object` (the entity/node it was granted on). The shape correction from the design
  note: there is no grant _id_ — a grant is a relation tuple with no surrogate key, so the
  tuple's object is what names it; `contracts` exports `grantRefFromProof` for this. The full
  proof chain is not persisted (`explain` re-derives it); only the pointer re-derivation
  cannot recover — which check was consulted at write time — is kept. Module code can neither
  supply it (not on `DomainEventInput`) nor suppress it; system/override actors are
  unconditionally allowed, so their checks are not recorded. The operation context is now
  built fresh per invoke so the accumulator cannot leak across operations.

  **K-35 — a scope-local denial log.** `assertAllowed` threw `PermissionDenied` and nothing
  recorded it. A denial happens in the scope's serialization domain and rolls its own
  operation back, so it cannot reach the directory access log and would be erased if written
  in the operation's transaction. It now lands in a scope-local `_substrat_denials` (actor,
  permission, node, operation, at, drained_at), recorded at the operation boundary the moment
  a `PermissionDenied` unwinds it — a fresh autocommit write after the rollback, so it
  survives. Only enforced denials record; a bare `ctx.check` a module branches on is not a
  denial. `PermissionDenied` now carries the checked `permission` and `node`.

  Both surfaces are additive kernel-schema changes (a nullable `_substrat_outbox.authorization`
  column and the new `_substrat_denials` table), applied on both adapters (pure-SQLite and the
  DO port) via KERNEL_DDL + an additive column on existing scopes. Legacy outbox rows read as
  `authorization` NULL — honestly unrecorded, not empty. Held to the same contract on both
  adapters by new cases in the permission contract suite.

  `restoreScopeLocal` on the Cloudflare host, `/internal/restore` on the vertical
  surface (VerticalClient + the Manyfold reference worker), a staff-only
  `POST /tenants/:tenantId/scopes/:scopeId/restore` control-plane route that delegates
  to the bound version's deployment, and `substrat scope restore <scopeId> --file
<backup>` — accepting a `scope pull` .sqlite, a local adapter-sqlite scope file, or

- d18a247: `HostAdmin.setTenantName` + `PATCH /tenants/:tenantId` — a display-only rename (the

  it to keep the shared directory's tenant names in step with team names, so the CLI's
  workspace picker shows the organization, not a placeholder; the CLI now lists
  workspaces name-first.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- b23c0a7: The Data tab grows a SQL console (#219): `HostAdmin.queryScope` runs ONE read-only SQL
  statement against a scope's own database, next to the table-shaped reads that stay safe
  by construction. User SQL reaching the DB moves the safety to statement-level
  enforcement, in two layers shared across adapters:

  - the kernel's `assertReadOnlyQuery` — a comment/string/identifier-aware token scan
    that rejects multi-statement input, a first keyword outside SELECT/WITH/VALUES/
    EXPLAIN, and any bare write/DDL/session verb anywhere (`WITH … INSERT INTO` is valid
    SQLite, so the first keyword alone proves nothing); deliberately over-strict, since a
    false positive costs a quoted identifier and a false negative forges the spine;
  - an adapter-authoritative backstop: better-sqlite3's `prepare().readonly`
    (sqlite3_stmt_readonly) on the pure adapter, and a transaction that ALWAYS rolls
    back inside the ScopeDO, whose `exec` has no read-only flag.

  Results are positional rows capped at `SCOPE_QUERY_ROW_MAX` (200) with a `truncated`
  flag — a ceiling, never an error. Same K-3 (tenantId, scopeId) cross-check and K-24
  access log as the table reads; the logged argument is the SQL itself. The refusal
  message prefix (`read-only console:`) is contract — pinned by the shared suite against
  both adapters and mapped to 400 by the transport.

  Transport: `POST /tenants/:tenantId/scopes/:scopeId/query` with the same
  vertical-delegation as the table reads (`VerticalClient.queryScope` →
  `/internal/query`); a vertical that cannot answer safely refuses with its own status,
  relayed verbatim — auth-server keeps refusing via its `/internal/*` 501 catch-all,
  because its DO redacts secret-bearing columns on table reads and arbitrary SQL would
  walk around the redaction. Editing rows stays out of scope forever: a write here would
  bypass the event log and forge the spine.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- ec89a88: Vertical lifecycle: delete a vertical, and block new installs of one.

  **`deleteVertical`** (HostAdmin + `DELETE /verticals/:slug`, staff-only): removes the
  registry row, its versions, and its channels — **refused while any scope is still
  bound** to the vertical, naming the count, so a delete can never strand a live scope's
  version pin or routing. Deployed dispatch scripts are left as orphans for the cleanup
  script (#248), never reaped inline. Audited. The console's vertical detail card gets a
  type-the-slug-to-confirm Delete.

  **`installsBlocked`** (new registry flag + `setVerticalInstallsBlocked` /
  `POST /verticals/:slug/install-block`, staff-only): the install kill-switch, orthogonal
  to `listed`. A blocked vertical is hidden from the dashboard's install catalog and the
  control plane refuses to provision an instance of it (403) — for everyone, owner
  included. Existing scopes keep serving: it gates provisioning, not serving. Additive
  `installs_blocked` column in both adapters (attempt-and-tolerate migration, default 0).
  Console gets a Block/Allow installs toggle and a "blocked" badge.

  The console also now shows **timestamps**: when each version was pushed (table +
  promote picker), when each channel pointer last moved, and when a vertical was
  registered.

### Patch Changes

- cd32011: Marketplace apps/verticals split + the empty-marketplace fix.

  **Adapters:** `registerVertical` now refreshes `listed` on an identical re-registration
  of a **builtin** vertical (it is seed metadata, derived from the catalog's `connected`
  flag). Rows registered before the `listed` column existed (migration default 0) were
  stuck unlisted forever, so the hosted marketplace rendered empty. A pushed (`cli`/`git`)
  vertical's `listed` stays untouched — re-pushing a published vertical still cannot
  silently unpublish it.

  **Dashboard:** the create-app page is now pure instantiation, grouped **Marketplace**
  (published) and **Your verticals** (your team's own, badged Private/Published, disabled
  until a version is promoted to prod). The Deployments page is renamed **Verticals**
  (`#/deployments` stays as an alias) and takes over the supply side: the GitHub
  import + one-click CI scaffold move there from create-app. `GET /api/catalog` returns
  `{owned, listed, source, installable}` and, in connected mode, merges the shared
  control plane's registry — so a pushed vertical shows up and (via the same fallback in
  `installSpecFor`) installs in production, not just embedded mode.

### Minor Changes

- 74c9d7b: Add `unassignRole` and `unlinkIdentity` to the `HostAdmin` surface — the inverses of `assignRole` and `linkIdentity`, so authority granted through the kernel can also be taken back.

  - `unassignRole(actor, assignment)` revokes a role assignment by tombstoning the role tuple (K-21): the checker stops resolving it, the tuple stays as audit evidence, and a later `assignRole` of the same `(principal, role, node)` reactivates it. Idempotent.
  - `unlinkIdentity(actor, tenantId, principal)` severs a principal's login from a tenant — keyed by principal (so the caller needs no external subject) and a DELETE rather than a tombstone, so `listIdentityTenants`/`resolveIdentity` stop returning it and a re-invite can re-link a fresh principal.

  Both are implemented in the SQLite and Cloudflare adapters (with a generic tenant/scope tuple revoke on the Cloudflare DOs) and add matching `adminAction` log entries. Together they unblock self-serve member removal: cut a member's access and drop the team from their surface.

## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- 0572a3b: **Typecheck on the native (Go) TypeScript compiler — `typescript` 5.6 → 7.**

  TypeScript 7 (the native compiler, formerly the `tsgo`/`@typescript/native-preview`
  rewrite) is now GA as `typescript@latest`. The binary is still `tsc`, so every package's
  `tsc -p … --noEmit` script is unchanged — only the toolchain pin moves. No source or
  public API changes; this bumps the published packages solely because their build now runs
  through the native compiler.

  Full-workspace `pnpm -r typecheck` drops to ~3s wall; per-package the native checker is
  roughly an order of magnitude faster (kernel 1.33s → 0.07s, control-plane-api 1.50s →
  0.12s, engine-invoicing 0.91s → 0.06s on this machine).

  Two migration deltas TS7's stricter resolution surfaced (both green on 5.6, red on 7):

  - **CSS side-effect imports (`TS2882`).** `import './ui.css'` in the six Vite app/admin
    surfaces now needs an ambient declaration. Fixed the way `demos/meridian/app` already
    did it — `"types": ["vite/client"]` in each app `tsconfig.json` (vite/client declares
    `*.css`) — rather than adding a stray `vite-env.d.ts`.
  - **`boundary-lint` node globals (`TS2584`/`TS2591`).** The linter CLI's `process`,
    `console`, and `node:fs`/`node:path` imports stopped resolving because the base tsconfig
    leaves `types` unset and TS7 no longer implicitly pulls in `@types/node` here. Added an
    explicit `"types": ["node"]` to `packages/boundary-lint/tsconfig.json`.

  Note: TS7 is a major bump that drops deprecated 5.x behavior. Editors should run their
  TS Server on 7 to keep CLI and IDE diagnostics aligned.

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- a277bb7: **Fix: a migration whose comment or string literal contains a semicolon no longer fails only on
  Durable Objects.**

  The two scope-host adapters applied module migrations differently, and that divergence was a
  latent trap:

  - the **SQLite** adapter hands the whole migration blob to better-sqlite3's `exec`, which parses
    comments, string literals, and multiple statements correctly;
  - the **Cloudflare** adapter ran `migration.sql.split(';')` and `exec`'d each fragment — a naive
    split that truncates a statement the moment a `;` appears inside a `--` / `/* */` comment or a
    string literal. SQLite then reports `incomplete input`.

  So a migration could be **green on every node test and CI run, then fail only on `workerd`** in
  production. (Found porting Meridian to Cloudflare: an `hr_absence_ledger` column comment read
  `-- signed decimal days; balance = SUM(delta)` and broke `CREATE TABLE`.)

  The fix replaces the naive split with `splitSqlStatements` — a small SQL-aware scanner that skips
  line and block comments, copies string literals through verbatim (including the `''` escape), and
  splits only on a top-level `;`. Comments are dropped from emitted statements, so a trailing
  comment can never become a comment-only fragment that `exec` rejects either.

  To make the class of bug unmissable and keep the adapters from diverging again, the shared
  contract-test module `testMod`'s migration now deliberately contains all the hard cases — a `;` in
  a line comment, in a block comment, and in a string-literal `DEFAULT`, plus a second statement.
  Every suite that provisions a scope therefore exercises it on **both** adapters; a naive splitter
  fails provisioning outright. `splitSqlStatements` also has direct unit coverage of each edge case.

- 7e17b16: **Connector state, and idempotent dispatch — the Scrive connector no longer duplicates
  documents on retry.**

  The connector took an injected `onDispatched` callback because it had nowhere to record what
  it had done. Delivery is at-least-once, so a redelivery created a _second_ Scrive document —
  duplicate legal paperwork to real signatories.

  The obvious fix — write the dispatch record into the scope — **deadlocks**, confirmed with a
  spike: a connector runs inside the scope's post-commit dispatch, and re-entering the scope
  actor from there waits on the task that is waiting for it. So the ledger lives in the
  **directory**, which a connector reaches through `ctx.admin` without touching the scope:

  ```ts
  HostAdmin.putConnectorState(connectionId, key, value);
  HostAdmin.getConnectorState(connectionId, key);
  ```

  Arbitrary JSON, keyed by `(connection, key)`, in a new `_substrat_connector_state` directory
  table on both adapters. Not audited — high-frequency machine state, one write per dispatch, the
  same class as `recordConnectionUse`. It dies with the connection: revoke cascades.

  The connector now checks the ledger before creating a document and skips if a prior dispatch is
  recorded, then records the dispatch after `start`. `onDispatched` is gone. A narrow residual
  window remains (ledger write fails after `start` succeeds → the retry still duplicates),
  closable with provider-side dedup via the `substrat_instance` tag the connector now sets.

  `getConnectorScope` (from #108) is deliberately unused here: recording a _signature_ back into
  the scope is the poll driver's job, where it runs as a top-level operation and re-entry is
  safe. Dispatch idempotency is not a scope write and must not be one.

  Contract tests on both adapters cover the state round-trip, upsert, and revoke-cascade; the
  connector's own suite proves a recorded dispatch is skipped rather than repeated.

- e4db6ed: **`HostAdmin.listConnectorState` — the read a poll driver needs to find its own outstanding work.**

  `getConnectorState(id, key)` answers "did I already do THIS one" from a deterministic key — the
  dispatch-idempotency path. It cannot answer "what is still outstanding", because a poller does
  not know the keys up front:

  ```ts
  listConnectorState(id: ConnectionId, prefix?: string): Promise<{ key: string; value: unknown }[]>
  ```

  Returns every state row for a connection, optionally narrowed to keys under `prefix`, ordered by
  key. A connector records one row per dispatch under `<provider>:dispatch:<id>`, and a scheduled
  sweep enumerates them (`prefix = '<provider>:dispatch:'`) to reconcile each against the provider.
  Without this a sweep would have to be handed every id it might reconcile, which defeats the point
  of a sweep.

  A directory-local machine read, the same class as `getConnectorState` — not audited. Implemented
  on both adapters (sqlite in-process; Cloudflare on the control-plane DO, prefix filtered
  coordinator-side to avoid LIKE/GLOB escaping); the contract-test suite covers prefix narrowing,
  ordering, the empty-match case, and per-connection isolation, so both adapters are held to the
  same behaviour.

  This is the enumeration half of the Scrive connector's poll path (#96): `drainDue` and the new
  `sweepScriveReconciliations` both still need a _timer_ to call them, which remains a deployment
  concern (no cron/alarm exists yet).

### Minor Changes

- 9c1f0bb: **The connection store, and the first encryption primitive in the codebase.**

  Per-tenant credentials for external providers had nowhere to live. `master-plan.md §6`
  committed to a connection store; `kernel-design.md §1` deferred "the integrations hub beyond
  its contract stub", and the stub was never written either — no `Connection` type, no
  credential storage, nothing.

  **Keyed on (tenant, vertical, provider)**, not tenant alone. A vertical is a blast-radius
  boundary (D-30) and verticals are built by different companies (D-33), so one vendor's host
  code must not reach a credential another vendor connected for the same tenant. It also
  matches how OAuth issues clients. Cross-vertical sharing, if a real case ever appears, is an
  explicit grant rather than the default.

  **`SecretBox` is a new adapter surface** — D-18 classifies the KMS as an adapter. Before this
  every `crypto.subtle` call in the repo was a one-way digest and every secret was a plaintext
  Worker binding: nothing per-tenant, nothing rotatable, nothing encrypted at rest.
  `webCryptoSecretBox` (AES-256-GCM, fresh IV per seal, key id for rotation) is the default;
  Cloudflare Secrets Store or an external KMS drop in behind the same interface. A host with no
  `SecretBox` **refuses to store a credential** rather than storing one in the clear.

  Two leaks designed out rather than remembered:

  - `_substrat_admin_log.before`/`after` take arbitrary JSON and the log is **append-only**, so
    a credential written there could never be removed. Connection mutations log metadata only.
  - `adminAction` is a closed enum that `auditLog` parses _every_ row through, so unrecognised
    actions fail the read of the whole log. Three members added.

  Revoking **destroys the sealed blob** and tombstones the row: a grant that once existed is
  evidence of why an access was allowed (K-21), but keeping the usable credential would make it
  a liability. Uniqueness is over live rows, so a revoked connection can be replaced.

  New on `HostAdmin`: `createConnection`, `listConnections`, `updateConnectionSecret`,
  `revokeConnection`, `openConnection`, `recordConnectionUse`. `openConnection` takes no actor
  and is not audited — the same exemption `resolveHostname` and `resolveIdentity` hold, for the
  same reason: an audit row per outbound HTTP call would drown the log that matters. Health
  (`lastOkAt`/`lastError`) is what an operator can act on instead.

  Ten new **contract** tests, so both adapters must agree — including that the credential
  appears in neither a metadata read nor the audit log, that another vertical cannot open it,
  and that revoking destroys it.

  **These methods take a `PlatformActorId`, which is a deliberate deferral, not an answer.**
  Connecting a provider is a tenant admin's act, and routing it through a platform actor is the
  defect D-31 named for `addMember`. Recorded in `docs/design/connections.md` §3.5; no console
  flow should be built on this signature until the question is settled with membership's.

- 113160a: **The inbound authority seam (#97): a connection is a subject.**

  A provider's callback has to write back into a scope, and it is not a person. `getScope`
  demands a `PrincipalId`, so a connector could dispatch a document and then be unable to record
  that it had — which under at-least-once delivery means a retry sends a **second** one.

  ```ts
  getConnectorScope(connectionId, scopeId): Promise<ScopeStub>;
  grantToConnection(actor, grant): Promise<void>;
  ```

  **The door inherits its narrowing.** A connection is keyed (tenant, vertical, provider), so
  `getConnectorScope` refuses another tenant's scope, another vertical's scope, and a revoked
  connection — none of it re-declared, just the key enforced where it could have been widened.

  **Authority is an ordinary permission grant**, not a second mechanism. Tuples already expire,
  tombstone on revoke (K-21), carry a proof, and appear in the permission diff. A parallel
  "allowed operations" list — the first design — would have been a second gate that only one of
  the two would show up in a review.

  **A connection is not a person, and the model now says so.** `PermissionChecker.check` takes a
  `CheckSubject` (`{ kind: 'principal' } | { kind: 'connection' }`) instead of a `PrincipalId`.
  Minting a principal per connection would have been cheaper and wrong: every audit view would
  show a `principal:` subject for something that is not one — the confusion `PlatformActorId`'s
  separate brand exists to prevent. So the tuple proof reads `connection:01J…`, the event actor
  is `{ connection }` beside the existing `{ system }`, and membership expansion is skipped for a
  connection rather than queried — it belongs to no org and holds no role, so a role carrying a
  permission cannot leak into it.

  **Breaking for custom checkers.** Any `PermissionChecker` implementation must take a
  `CheckSubject`; `asPrincipal(id)` is exported for the common case. Both built-in adapters and
  the contract suite are updated.

  Five new tests in the permission contract suite, against the real tuple checker on both
  adapters: opening the door confers nothing · a grant allows exactly what it names and proves it
  with a `connection:` tuple · no roles or memberships leak in · another tenant's or vertical's
  scope is unreachable · revoking the connection closes the door in the same act that destroys
  the credential.

- 3fb38da: **`registerConnector` — an executor that also gets a credential and sanctioned egress.**

  The existing `ExecutorHandler` receives only `HostAdmin`, which is right for the one executor
  that exists (a directory write) and insufficient for anything that talks to a provider: no
  per-tenant credential, and no way to make an HTTP call that the platform can police.

  ```ts
  registerConnector(id, eventType, handler, options?)

  interface ConnectorContext {
    admin; tenantId; scopeId; vertical;
    connection(provider): Promise<ConnectorConnection>;   // opened credential + bound fetch
  }
  ```

  **Tenant and vertical are ambient**, taken from the event's scope rather than passed in, so a
  connector cannot reach a credential another vertical connected even by accident.

  **`fetch` is bound to the connection, not to the context.** Health has to land on the right
  row by construction; an ambient `ctx.fetch` would make the runtime guess which connection a
  call belonged to, and it would guess wrong the first time a connector talked to two. The
  handler is _given_ its fetch rather than importing one — the same move `ctx.sql` makes for
  module code, and for the same reason: timeouts, egress policy and health become properties of
  the seam instead of conventions an author has to remember.

  Kept as a second registration rather than widening `ExecutorHandler`: a membership executor
  should not be handed the machinery to call the internet. Both ride the same hardened dispatch,
  journal and retry policy from #100.

  Hosts take an optional `fetch`, so a provider can be stood up in memory. That is the only way
  to exercise a connector end to end before vendor credentials exist, and it stays useful
  afterwards because a real provider will not return 503 on demand.

  Three new contract tests across both adapters: a connector receives its tenant's credential and
  records health on success; a provider error is recorded on the connection; and a tenant with
  the SKU but no connection fails the delivery visibly rather than silently doing nothing.

- 2becfd5: **Executor deliveries retry, back off, and dead-letter instead of escaping the operation.**

  `ExecutorHandler` is the only outbound seam in the system. That was fine while the only
  executor wrote to the local directory; it stops being fine the moment one makes an HTTP
  call, which is the most likely thing in the system to fail transiently.

  Three specific defects, all fixed:

  - **A throwing handler escaped `invoke()` after the transaction committed.** The caller
    was told their work failed when it had not. A delivery failure and an operation failure
    are different facts, and only the second belongs in the caller's result.
  - **A poison event wedged the queue permanently.** The scan is `ORDER BY o.id`, so the
    failing event was re-selected first on every drain and executor _N+1_ never ran while
    _N_ threw.
  - **Nothing retried on its own.** With no timer anywhere, a failed delivery was retried
    only if someone happened to invoke another operation on that same scope — and nothing
    reported that it hadn't.

  New surface:

  ```ts
  registerExecutor(id, eventType, handler, retry?: ExecutorRetryPolicy)
  drainDue(tenantId, scopeId): Promise<ExecutorDrainReport>
  executorDeadLetters(tenantId, scopeId): Promise<ExecutorDeadLetter[]>
  ```

  Retry policy is **per executor** rather than a host constant: the defaults suit a
  directory write, and a connector making an outbound call wants a longer tail.
  `_substrat_deliveries` gains `attempts` and `next_attempt_at`, added by `ALTER` on both
  adapters — the defaults read as "terminal", which is correct for every row already there.
  Consumer dispatch is untouched.

  Behavioural change worth noting: an operation can now report success while its external
  effect has not happened yet. That is the correct semantics for an outbox, and it is what
  the path was already doing silently — the difference is that failures are now recorded,
  retried, and readable instead of being thrown at whoever held the request.

  Prerequisite for the integrations hub ([`docs/design/connections.md`](docs/design/connections.md)).
  Scheduling `drainDue` from a cron trigger or Durable Object alarm is not included here.

### Patch Changes

- d881f75: **Correct the Scrive connector against the real API, and widen the connector fetch body.**

  The connector was written from Scrive's docs. Driving the full lifecycle against
  `api-testbed.scrive.com` exposed three things the docs left ambiguous and the docs-reading got
  wrong — exactly the "a mock encodes the author's reading of the docs" caveat cashing out:

  - **Auth is OAuth1 PLAINTEXT, not OAuth2 bearer.** The Scrive UI's "Client credentials" and
    "Token credentials" are two halves of one four-part signature, not two schemes. The
    connection secret shape becomes `{ clientId, clientSecret, tokenId, tokenSecret }`.
  - **`POST /documents/new` returns no top-level `status`** — only `get` does. The connector now
    parses mutation responses for their id and reads status from `get`, which is the right design
    regardless (don't trust a mutation's echo).
  - **`setfile` is `multipart/form-data`**, not a base64 body.

  The kernel change: `ConnectorRequestInit.body` accepts `Uint8Array` as well as `string`, because
  a real upload is binary and a string body corrupts the file. Web `fetch` accepts both, so the
  adapters pass it straight through.

  `ScriveMock` is updated to the real request encodings (OAuth1 header, form-encoded `update`,
  multipart `setfile`, exactly-one-author) so it fails a connector regression rather than passing
  a shape the real API rejects. A new opt-in `test/live.test.ts` drives the real lifecycle when
  testbed credentials are present and skips otherwise, so CI stays offline while a local run
  verifies against reality.

  Still incomplete: the write-back (needs `getConnectorScope`, now available on `HostAdmin`) and a
  poll driver. And `se_bankid`-to-sign is disabled on the testbed account, so the BankID
  round-trip is unverified.

### Minor Changes

- 27872cc: Scopes are provisioned as `provisioning` and activated on confirmation (K-31).

  `provisionScope` wrote the directory row as `active`, so the row claimed a usable
  scope before anything had built one — and only the vertical can build one, because the
  DO class bundles the modules and lives in the vertical's deployment. The `provisioning`
  state existed in the enum for exactly this and was unused.

  `HostAdmin.activateScope` moves `provisioning → active`, through the same transition
  graph the other lifecycle moves use, so it is audited and cannot revive a suspended
  scope. `getScope` refuses anything not active, so an unconfirmed row is inert rather
  than misleading.

  `ControlPlaneClient.activateScope` is the push-mode equivalent, and the control-plane
  API gains `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/activate`.

  Migrations are still attempted for a `provisioning` scope before it is refused, so the
  lazy retry and its attempt counter survive — they are the only self-healing there is
  until the reconciliation sweep exists. A scope held back by a failed migration now
  reports the migration error rather than a bare "not active".

### Minor Changes

- c54637b: The hostname map: `hostname → (tenant, scope, vertical, surface, region)`.

  A provisioned scope had no URL, so "validate it works in production" had nowhere to
  point. `contracts/routing.ts` adds `hostnameBinding` and `routeTarget`, and `HostAdmin`
  adds `bindHostname` / `setHostnameStatus` / `listHostnames` / `resolveHostname`.

  `surface` is the correction: one hostname per scope was already wrong, because a single
  scope fronts a storefront and a back office, or a player app and a manager console.

  `region` sits on the binding rather than in a router deployed per jurisdiction, because
  Cloudflare's Regional Services is configured per hostname — residency is one more
  column, not a second topology.

  Bindings have a lifecycle (`pending` → `verifying` → `active`, or `failed` with a note),
  since a custom domain is DNS validation and certificate issuance rather than a string
  somebody sets. Only `active` resolves. `resolveHostname` takes no actor and is not
  logged — the machine-path carve-out `resolveIdentity` already has — and does not
  re-check suspension, which `getScope` owns.

  Additive on every published surface: new schemas, new `HostAdmin` methods, new tables.
  Nothing existing changed shape.

### Minor Changes

- 6900431: The directory becomes readable, and gets an HTTP surface.

  **New package: `@substrat-run/control-plane-api`** (AGPL-3.0-only + commercial,
  like the kernel it sits on). One Hono router over `HostAdmin` — the audited
  control-plane transport. Web-standard only, so the same router mounts in a Worker
  holding the `controlPlane` binding or behind a Node server. It is not module code:
  it never receives a `ctx` and never runs in a scope's serialization domain.

  **`HostAdmin` gains a read side.** The write side was complete; nothing could
  enumerate what it had written.

  - `listScopes(filter?)` / `getScopeRecord(tenantId, scopeId)` — the scope
    inventory §3.2 always claimed the directory was. `getScopeRecord` cross-checks
    the pair and returns `undefined` for another tenant's scope, the same
    fail-closed rule `getScope` applies (K-3).
  - `listRoles(filter?)` — roles were writable and not enumerable since the
    permission model shipped. Returns `TenantRole` (a `RoleDefinition` plus its
    tenant).
  - `auditLog(filter?)` widens: filter by scope, actor, action or time; `limit`,
    `cursor` and `order`. The cursor is the entry's own ULID — order is
    chronological, so a page carries its own continuation. **The default order is
    unchanged** (oldest first), so existing callers do not shift.

  **The `scope` contract is now enforced rather than aspirational.** It described
  `slug`/`kind`/`name`/`parentScopeId` and was parsed by nothing while the table had
  none of those columns. Every read now parses through it, and `Scope` gains
  `vertical`.

  **`ProvisionScopeInput` extends additively** — `slug`, `kind`, `name`, `vertical`
  are optional with behaviour-preserving defaults, so existing callers are
  untouched. An unnamed scope's slug defaults to its lowercased id (a ULID
  lowercases into a valid slug, so it is valid and unique by construction).

  **`schemaVersion` and `vertical` stop being placeholders.** Both shipped as
  columns written by nothing — `schemaVersion` was always `'0'`, `vertical` always
  `null`. `schemaVersion` is now the applied-migration count; `vertical` is stamped
  onto audit targets for scope-lifecycle actions.

  **Directory schema change, applied in place by both adapters.** The `scopes` table
  gains `parent_scope_id`/`slug`/`kind`/`name`/`vertical`, plus a unique index on
  `(tenant_id, slug)` and one on `tenants(slug)`. The directory is not a module and
  has no `SqlMigration[]` journal, so each adapter upgrades on open: add the columns,
  backfill legacy rows to the same defaults `resolveScopeRecord` applies, then create
  the unique indexes **after** the backfill (a unique index over NULL slugs would
  permit the duplicates it exists to forbid). No action is required of callers; an
  existing directory opens and migrates itself.

  **Slug uniqueness is now enforced**, which it never was despite the contract saying
  "unique within tenant". `createTenant` and `provisionScope` fail closed on a
  collision rather than reporting a silent no-op — `INSERT OR IGNORE` would have
  swallowed a colliding-slug-different-id create and reported it as idempotent.

### Minor Changes

- 5dd4085: Zod 4, and `contracts` re-exports `z` — closing a live from-scratch trap

  **The trap.** The published packages depend on `zod ^3.25.0` while `pnpm add zod`
  — which getting-started told users to run — installs Zod 4. pnpm resolves both:
  Zod 3 nested for our packages, Zod 4 for the user. Two copies, both "correct".
  Zod schemas do not compose across majors, so the moment a user wrote the pattern
  CLAUDE.md mandates ("operation inputs go through Zod schemas at the boundary")
  composing a contracts schema into their own —

                                                                                                                                                              z.object({ facility: entityRef, unitPrice: money })

  — it failed at RUNTIME with `Invalid element at key "facility": expected a Zod
schema`, an error pointing nowhere near the cause. Not an exotic pattern: it is
  what `engines/workorder` itself does (`unitPrice: money`, `facility: entityRef`),
  so anyone copying the reference hit it immediately. Found by building a vertical
  from scratch against the published packages — the flow the docs describe and
  nobody had walked.

  **Two fixes, because they solve different halves.**

  1. **Zod 4 everywhere.** Aligns with what the ecosystem installs by default, so a
     user who reaches for `zod` gets our major. No code changes were needed — the
     schema subset in use (`z.object`, `.regex`, `.brand`, `.min`, `.optional`,
     `z.infer`) is stable across the major, and the one `z.record` was already the
     2-arg form Zod 4 requires. Build, typecheck, and the full suite pass unchanged.
  2. **`contracts` re-exports `z`.** The durable half: importing `z` from
     `@substrat-run/contracts` means the consumer never installs zod at all, so the
     versions cannot diverge. Fix 1 makes the trap dormant; fix 2 keeps it dormant
     when Zod 5 ships.

  `zod` is dropped from the getting-started install line; docs and the `substrat`
  skill both import `z` from contracts.

  **Breaking for consumers on Zod 3** — deliberately taken now, while there are
  effectively none, rather than later when there are.

  **Still open:** making `zod` a `peerDependency`. Contracts' schemas are part of
  its public API — consumers are meant to compose them, so their copy must be ours
  — which is textbook peer. As a plain dependency it nests silently instead of
  failing at install. Left as a separate call.

### Patch Changes

- db77d8c: `HostAdmin` is now asynchronous

  Every `HostAdmin` method returns a `Promise` — writes (`createTenant`,
  `setTenantStatus`, the scope-lifecycle transitions, `defineRole`/`assignRole`/
  `grant`/`grantToOrg`/`addMember`, `grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement`,
  `linkIdentity`) and reads (`getTenant`, `listTenants`, `listEntitlements`,
  `auditLog`, `resolveIdentity`) alike. `registerModule`/`defineOperation` stay
  synchronous (code-time bookkeeping); `getScope`/`provisionScope` were already async.

  Why: the pure adapter's synchronous admin worked only because it is in-process.
  The Cloudflare adapter (D-14) proved a durable/remote control plane — a Durable
  Object — cannot be synchronous, so the second adapter forced the interface to
  evolve. This is the two-adapter discipline doing its job. Callers now `await`
  admin calls; adapter-sqlite's methods present their synchronous SQLite work as
  Promises. Behavior, error messages, and every contract assertion are unchanged.

- 4ba235e: Cloudflare Durable-Object adapter — milestone 1: contract suites green in workerd

  The second adapter (D-14) now runs the **shared** contract suites against **real
  Durable Objects** in workerd. One scope = one SQLite-backed `ScopeDO`; operations
  run inside `ctx.storage.transaction(async …)` (the DO analogue of the pure
  adapter's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT/ROLLBACK`), with per-scope serialization,
  lazy migrations-on-wake, guards, entity links, and the outbox→consumer dispatch
  loop. `scopeHostContractSuite` + `permissionContractSuite` pass unchanged (43
  pass, 1 skip); the pure-SQLite adapter stays green.

  - **contract-tests**: handlers extracted into an importable `modules.ts` so a DO
    can bundle them (a DO cannot execute closures created in another isolate);
    assertions unchanged. New `supportsRuntimeRegistration` capability flag — the
    one dynamic-late-registration test is skipped on adapters whose module set is
    code-time (CF), since a deployed DO bundle cannot gain code at runtime.
  - **kernel**: `ulid()` is now **monotonic** within a process (ULID spec's
    monotonic factory) — two ids minted in the same millisecond sort in creation
    order, making the audit log's and outbox's "ULID order is chronological"
    invariant actually hold. Fixes a latent same-millisecond ordering flake.

  Milestone-1 limitation, deliberately scoped: `HostAdmin` is a **synchronous**
  interface, which cannot be backed by an async Durable Object — so the coordinator
  holds the directory (tenants/scopes/entitlements/audit/identities/roles) in
  memory and forwards only the cross-DO subset (roles + tenant tuples) to a
  `ControlPlaneDO`. Making the control plane durable needs an async admin surface —
  a contract evolution the second adapter surfaced (exactly what D-14 is for), and
  the next step before deploying a real vertical.

- d929987: Control plane §4.3: entitlement store — `manifest.entitlementKey` finally gates loading

  `manifest.entitlementKey` was declared on every module and read by nothing (D-20
  was a promise with no mechanism). Now a per-tenant `_substrat_entitlements` set
  gates module loading, default-deny: an operation whose owning module's SKU flag
  the tenant does not hold does not resolve — the same fail-closed shape as manifest
  `withdraws`. New `HostAdmin.grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement` (idempotent,
  audited) and `listEntitlements`. The check runs per invoke (the simple, uncached
  path — a DO-cached variant is kernel-design open question 5). Entitlement flags
  are the SKUs meter 2 (§5) counts. Demo seeds grant the flags for the modules each
  vertical runs — the SKU model in use.

- f717014: Control plane §4.4: `PlatformActor` seam + append-only admin audit log (D-30, K-20)

  Every `HostAdmin` mutation (defineRole / assignRole / grant / grantToOrg / addMember)
  now takes a `PlatformActorId` — a staff subject branded distinctly from a tenant
  `PrincipalId` — and writes an append-only row to a new `_substrat_admin_log` in the
  directory, stamped host-side (actor, action, target, before/after, timestamp). A new
  `HostAdmin.auditLog(filter?)` reads it back — the read path for the console history and
  the permission-diff human checkpoint. `defineRole` captures the prior role in `before`.

  Pre-release breaking surface change kept at patch: `HostAdmin` method signatures gained
  a leading `actor` argument. Locally the actor is a dev stub; real staff auth gates
  exposing the surface, not building it.

- 6393a8e: Control plane §4.2: scope lifecycle + structural audit + mandatory tenant

  `provisionScope` becomes the first audited scope-lifecycle transition — it now
  takes a `PlatformActor`, requires an existing active tenant (a scope with no
  tenant record fails closed), and audits. New `HostAdmin.suspendScope`,
  `unsuspendScope`, `archiveScope`, and `unarchiveScope` implement the §3.3
  transitions, validate the legal transition graph (fail closed on an illegal
  one), and audit before/after; un-archive is an explicit restore, never a silent
  flag flip. `getScope` now gates on both tenant-active AND scope-active, so
  suspend/archive actually contain.

  Audit is now a single `recordAdmin` choke point every mutation routes through —
  "no mutation without a durable record" holds by construction, not per-method
  discipline. The step-2 "legacy scopes without a tenant" passthrough is removed:
  every scope has a tenant with a status.

- 2dd4175: Control plane §4.1: tenant registry + lifecycle status

  A real `tenants` table in the directory replaces "a tenant is a ULID nobody used
  before". New `HostAdmin.createTenant` (idempotent, audited), `setTenantStatus`,
  `listTenants`, and `getTenant`. A tenant whose status is not `active` fails
  `getScope` closed for every scope under it — the K-3 fail-closed path, the
  containment lever for non-payment or an incident, reversible without deletion.
  Scopes provisioned without a tenant record (legacy path) are not gated, keeping
  the change backward-compatible.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 604883b: Manifest-declared operation guards and operation withdrawal — compliance gates a reviewer can enumerate.

  A vertical declares an unconditional gate in its manifest (`guards: [{ before, predicate, config }]`); a module contributes the named predicate (`predicates` on `ModuleRegistration`, typed `GuardPredicate`); the kernel evaluates it inside the guarded operation's own transaction, before the handler, failing closed. `withdraws` lets a vertical suppress an engine's default operation binding so the guarded wrapper is the only door — without it a gate is reviewable but bypassable. Both are optional and additive: existing manifests parse and behave unchanged.

  The protocol engine gains a `protocol/all-signed` predicate and the `requireCountersigned` in-scope function; the work-order engine exports `closeWorkOrder` as an in-scope function (its `workorder/close` operation is now the thin binding). The scope-host contract suite covers guards and withdrawal, so every adapter must implement both.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7583dab: First end-to-end feature set: the kernel deltas that carry a running vertical.

  - **Contracts**: relationship tuples with proof-path `Decision`s (an unexplained allow is
    unrepresentable), entity-narrowed capability grants, `entityRelations` and `ui`
    contributions on the module manifest, shared `money` schema with exact decimal
    arithmetic, attachment `visibility` classification.
  - **Kernel**: `registerModule` (manifest + migrations + operations + consumers),
    `OperationContext.link`, entity-aware `PermissionChecker`, `HostAdmin` surface for
    roles/assignments/grants/membership, `assertAllowed`/`PermissionDenied`.
  - **adapter-sqlite**: built-in constrained tuple permission engine (fixed four-rule
    algebra, proof paths, grant expiry, org membership), per-scope migration journal
    (lazy on wake, crash-safe), per-operation transactions (writes and emitted events
    commit or roll back together), local at-least-once event dispatch with a kernel
    delivery journal and system-actor consumer contexts.
  - **contract-tests**: atomicity, migration-journal, dispatch exactly-once, and tuple
    permission suites — every adapter must pass all of them unchanged.
  - **Engines**: first releases of `@substrat-run/engine-workorder` (state machine, append-only
    time/material, fat completion events) and `@substrat-run/engine-invoicing` (event-consuming
    snapshot fakturaunderlag with provenance, immutable once exported).
