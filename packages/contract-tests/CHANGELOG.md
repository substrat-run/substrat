### Patch Changes

- fcb5700: The entity-check conformance kit can drive an operation that names a second entity of the kind it narrows to (#939). `coEntities: { 'ticket0/merge': { intoConversationId: 'conversation' } }` has the kit make that entity per case and grant it the same keys as the target, so `merge`-shaped operations join the behavioural pair instead of sitting in the receipt's "not driven" table; a co-entity naming a field the schema does not have is reported rather than counted as coverage. The receipt lists every second entity the kit supplies, and says plainly that a check on it is not what the pair asserts.

- 3561f7f: Act as a principal with the real actor preserved (K-42)

  Supporting a customer's live vertical meant asking them to screenshot things: there was
  no supported way to see what a named principal sees, and the only impersonation in the
  tree was the `ALLOW_DEV_HEADER` dev bypass. Every platform grows this surface eventually,
  and the version that grows by itself is a session swap that loses the real actor — which
  is exactly the version that fails an audit.

  An impersonated operation now carries **two** actors:

  ```ts
  const session = await host.admin.beginImpersonation(staff, {
    tenantId,
    scopeId,
    principal: anna,
    reason: "ticket #4182 — the invoice screen is empty",
    // minutes: 15 by default, capped at IMPERSONATION_MAX_MINUTES
    // mode: 'read-only' by default
  });
  const stub = await host.getImpersonatedScope(session.id, tenantId, scopeId);
  await stub.invoke("callout/list-orders"); // answers as Anna
  ```

  The permission model answers about the **impersonated** principal, through the ordinary
  checker with no override branch — so a session against a principal who holds nothing is
  refused precisely where that principal would be. The staff actor rides beside it as a
  kernel-stamped `impersonation` on the outbox envelope, the denial row and the
  platform-intent journal, on K-34's pattern: absent from `DomainEventInput`, so module
  code can neither claim a session nor drop one. It is absent from `ctx` too — a vertical
  that could read the session could hide rows from it.

  **`read-only` is the default, and it is a mechanism rather than a promise.** The
  effecting verbs (`emit`, `requestPlatform`, `grant`, `revoke`, `link`) refuse by name,
  and the transaction is rolled back instead of committed — which is what holds when a
  handler writes a row with plain `ctx.sql.exec` and calls none of them. The operation
  still runs and still answers; only the writes do not survive.

  Sessions are bounded and reason-carrying, admin-logged **before** they can be used
  (K-33's failure ordering), and re-read on every invoke rather than once at the door — a
  stub is a capability, so a session checked only when it was minted would expire for
  everybody except the one caller holding it. `endImpersonation` closes one early;
  `listImpersonations` reads the log and is access-logged like every other staff read.

  Both adapters, held to one shared `impersonationContractSuite`. Additive throughout: the
  new envelope, denial and intent fields are optional, and a null means "nobody was
  impersonating" rather than "unrecorded".

### Patch Changes

- ec1f8e8: The last three packages declare their operation surface, so no entity-check claim is a grep

  #865 asked for the entity-check conformance kit to reach fourteen packages, and #891 split
  out the half where the recipe did not apply: a package with no declared operation registry
  has nothing to convert. #891 closed five of them. These are the last three.

  `engines/invites`, `engines/metering` and `demos/manyfold` each gain a declared operation
  surface (`src/operations.ts`, plus an entity registry for metering and a `schemas.ts` for
  manyfold), and their node-only assessment moves from `nodeOnlySuite` to
  `declaredNodeOnlySuite`. The difference is what the claim is made OF:

  - **Before:** a tripwire over the module's own source — no two-argument `ctx.check(perm,
ref)` appears in it. Lexical. It proves an absence rather than a behaviour, and a check
    assembled through a helper or across lines is invisible to it.
  - **After:** `planEntityCheckCoverage` reads the declaration the same way the conformance
    kit does, and the claim is that the plan is empty. Exact. It goes red when an operation
    DECLARES a narrowed check, not when someone happens to spell one on one line.

  Each also gains the assertion that is easy to leave out — every operation still says what
  it checks, because an ungated operation produces an empty plan too. `invites/accept` is
  the one operation in the three that genuinely checks nothing (the invitation itself is the
  authority) and it now declares `narrows` with the reason, so the exception is written down
  rather than indistinguishable from an oversight.

  That exception needed one new word to state. `narrows.checks: []` already meant "no key of
  MINE is walked", which is also true of a walk over a composed engine's key — Callout's
  portal walk checks `workorder:read`, and a vertical restating another module's permissions
  is the defect the empty list exists to avoid. So a genuinely ungated operation adds
  `narrows.unchecked: true`, and the conformance receipt counts it on its own row instead of
  reporting "1 per-entity proof walk" under a header counting zero narrowed checks.

  Two consequences beyond the assessment: the host now parses these operations' inputs at
  the door (#893) from the same schemas the handlers already parsed, and a vertical
  composing invites or metering can declare an operation returning their shapes without
  transcribing them.

  `nodeOnlySuite` stays exported for a module that has not declared yet — a vertical
  mid-build, a module outside this workspace — with its header corrected: no package in this
  repo needs it any more.

- c601b68: An entity's history is a read the kernel owns

  Reading `_substrat_outbox` for one entity is a sanctioned projection — rule 3 bans writes
  to the spine, not reads, because "show me the history of this thing" has no other source.
  What was missing was a supported SHAPE, and five demos wrote the query by hand in its
  absence. They did not agree, and the disagreements were not cosmetic.

  | Demo               | Order                | Cursor        |
  | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------- |
  | callout, handlebar | `rowid`              | `rowid`       |
  | meridian, rally    | `occurred_at, rowid` | `occurred_at` |
  | manyfold           | `rowid`              | _(unpaged)_   |

  **Meridian's and rally's paging dropped events.** The step was `occurred_at > ?`, so every
  row sharing the last one's timestamp was skipped — and sharing it is the norm, not a rare
  tie: `ctx.now()` is stable for a whole invocation (#812), so every event one operation
  emits carries the identical instant. A page boundary inside them lost the rest, and no
  test would have caught it.

  ```ts
  import { readTimeline } from "@substrat-run/kernel";

  assertAllowed(await ctx.check(WO.read, entity)); // the caller checks. always
  return readTimeline(ctx, entity, input); // { entries, nextCursor }
  ```

  Each entry is `{ id, type, occurredAt, actor }`, and two of those four are not what the
  hand-written `SELECT` was getting:

  - **`actor` is the union, decoded.** The column stores `JSON.stringify(actor)` over
    `PrincipalId | { system } | { connection }`, so a principal is stored _with its quotes_.
    `SELECT actor` returns a string that looks usable and is not; the obvious repair — trim
    the quotes — then breaks on a system actor. An agent building a timeline hit this as a
    real bug and had to read the adapter source to find it.
  - **`id` is the entity's version at that point** (#901) — the token `ctx.versionOf`
    returns and `If-Match` compares (#129), so listing the history, naming a version and
    refusing a stale write stop being three vocabularies. It is therefore the cursor:
    `ORDER BY id` is creation order because `ulid()` is monotonic, and `OUTBOX_ENTITY_INDEX`
    makes the walk a seek with no new DDL. A `rowid` cursor could use neither, and does not
    survive a restore.

  `readHistory` is the same walk with what a history VIEW needs — `payload`, `authorization`
  (which permission, and which grant), `piiClass`/`subjectId`. Two nullables there are facts
  rather than gaps: **`payload` is null after an erasure**, because a shred keeps the
  envelope and destroys what was said, so a history correctly degrades to "someone changed
  this, then"; and `authorization` is null when the row predates it being recorded, which is
  not the same as having checked nothing.

  Neither read checks a permission, deliberately. A helper that gated itself would be a
  second, invisible policy surface; one that gated itself on nothing would be an unchecked
  path into every event in the scope. Both are worse than the one line at the call site.

  Also fixed on the way: Callout's and Handlebar's hand-mounted timeline routes never applied
  the page projection `mountOperations` does for declared routes, so since these operations
  became paged (#811) they answered `{ entries, nextCursor }` to an app that typed the body
  as an array and called `.map` on it. The scenarios invoke the operation and never the
  route, so nothing saw it. Both now emit the `Link` continuation and both apps WALK it —
  reading only the body is how a history strip silently stops at twenty events, which an
  order reaches in a working week — and a route-level test drives more events than one page
  fits over real HTTP, since that is the only layer where the truncation exists.

  Both adapters are held to all of it by a new contract suite.

- 4f612fc: A retried write is free — `Idempotency-Key`, the recorded response, and the 409

  A client whose request times out does not know whether the work happened. It retries, and
  there is a second work order. Agents make this acute rather than novel: they retry more
  aggressively than people, and faster. A client now sends a token it chose, and the same
  token on the retry returns the first response instead of doing the work again:

  ```http
  POST /api/workorders
  Idempotency-Key: dispatch-4471
  ```

  ```http
  200 OK
  Idempotency-Replayed: true
  ```

  **Nothing is declared, which is the difference from #129.** Every operation on an unsafe
  method honours the header, because a retried write creating a second entity is a hazard on
  all of them — where a lost update is a hazard on the field-bag shape alone, which is why
  `concurrency` is opt-in and this is not. The client opts in by sending a key; the server
  never requires one. Callout's end-to-end test proves exactly that: a vertical that changed
  nothing gets it.

  The seam is the one #129 asked for rather than a second interception point beside it.
  `InvokeOptions` already said so — _"`If-Match` and `Idempotency-Key` are ONE precondition
  pass at one point in the invoke"_ — so this declared into that bag, and the mount reads two
  headers where it read one.

  **The recording is written inside the operation's own transaction**, and three properties
  fall out of that placement rather than from mechanisms of their own:

  - **A failed request is retried, not replayed.** The operation threw, the transaction rolled
    back, and the recording went with it. Nothing to find, so the retry executes — correctly,
    because nothing happened the first time. Recording failures would have meant deciding
    which of them are permanent, and a retry after a 500 is the most ordinary thing a client
    does.
  - **A replayed response describes work that committed.** There is no window in which the
    recording exists and the rows it describes do not.
  - **A concurrent retry cannot slip past.** Invocations serialise per scope in both adapters,
    so the duplicate takes its turn after the first has committed. Every other implementation
    of this needs an in-flight state and a "still processing" 409; this one does not, and that
    is a property of the host rather than something to rely on quietly.

  Four things this had to get right:

  - **A key belongs to the subject that sent it.** Two clients will both choose `1`. The row
    is keyed `(subject, key)`, so a cross-principal replay is not a check someone could
    forget — it is a row that cannot be reached.

  - **A key names one request.** The fingerprint is SHA-256 over the operation and its
    **parsed** input — parsed, so a retry omitting an optional field the original sent at its
    default value is still the same request. Same key, different request is `conflict` (409),
    never the earlier response: a client handed an answer to a question it did not ask will
    act on it.

  - **Unrecordable fails closed.** A result over 128 KiB records the key with no body, and a
    replay of it is refused rather than executed again. The original did complete, so
    re-running is the one answer that is certainly wrong.

  - **An unacknowledged key is refused.** Same shape as #129's skew check and a sharper
    failure: an old ScopeDO that drops `ifMatch` skips a comparison, while one that drops the
    key **runs the operation** and returns 200. The DO acknowledges, and a coordinator that
    sent a key and sees no acknowledgement refuses the success.

  **Opting out is a line someone wrote.** An operation whose response must not be recorded —
  a freshly minted secret, a one-time token — declares `idempotency: false`, and the host then
  refuses the header rather than silently storing the response or silently executing twice.
  Opt-out rather than opt-in because the two read differently in a diff: a missing opt-in is
  invisible, while `idempotency: false` is something a reviewer can ask about.

  Retention is **24 hours**, pruned opportunistically inside the transaction that adds a row —
  no sweeper, no second schedule, and a fleet that never sends a key never pays for it. The
  window is not only a storage bound: a recorded response is a second copy of what the
  operation returned, sitting outside the erasure path that reaches the outbox. A copy that
  expires in a day is defensible; one that never expires is a second database of personal data
  with no owner.

  No new error vocabulary. `conflict` has been in the closed taxonomy since #113, and both
  refusals narrow it with a `reason` slug (`idempotency_key_reused`,
  `idempotency_replay_unavailable`) rather than inventing a code.

  Two things worth knowing about the emitted document. The header is documented on every
  unsafe operation rather than per declaration — that IS the surface, and a client made to
  work out which writes are retryable will assume none of them are. And it appears only where
  `mountOperations` serves the route: Meridian's and Manyfold's `openapi.json` are unchanged
  because they hand-write their `/api/op/*` route and pass no options to `invoke`, so
  documenting the header there would advertise a behaviour those servers do not implement.

  A replay is **not** a fresh authorization — the recorded response is returned without
  running the handler, and the permission check lives inside the handler. What bounds it is
  that a caller only ever reaches responses it received itself, and that the window is a day.
  Stated in `kernel/src/idempotency.ts` rather than discovered, because the alternative —
  re-running the operation so the permission can be re-checked — is the duplicate execution
  this exists to prevent.

  Verified: an 11-case contract suite on both adapters, including across the real ScopeDO hop,
  mutation-checked; 4 mount tests; 3 end-to-end HTTP tests against Callout's real route table
  proving a retried `POST` opens one work order. Full suite, typecheck, boundary-lint and all
  15 generated-file gates green. No migration diff; no permission surface change.

- e401927: A narrowed check may name several entity types, and the schema says which

  Three timeline operations took `entityType: z.string()` and narrowed to whatever the caller
  named, while `{ key, entity, idFrom }` holds one fixed type. #889 declared `entity: 'workorder'`
  on two of them — accurate to the app, narrower than the operation — and filed #890 asking whether
  the answer was a new `entityFrom` field or simply a bounded input.

  **It is both, and the reason is a caller the issue did not know about.** Every call site in the
  app, the routes and the portal beats passes one constant, so the cheap answer looked complete:
  pin `z.literal('workorder')` and the declaration becomes exact. It isn't complete — Callout's
  §12 and Handlebar's counter-signature beat read a **protocol's** spine rows through the same
  operation. Two admissible types, then, not one, and the literal turned both scenarios red on
  first run, which is how the second type was found at all.

  - `entityFrom: 'entityType'` names the input field carrying the type, beside `idFrom` naming the
    one carrying the id. It is an alternative to `entity`, not an addition — one type or a field
    that names several.
  - **The admissible types are not listed in the declaration.** They are read off that field's own
    schema (`z.enum(['workorder', 'protocol'])`), so the set exists once. #890's own worry about
    `entityFrom` was that the kit would need a caller-written list, and a list a caller writes goes
    stale; reading the schema is what avoids it.
  - An open `z.string()` behind `entityFrom` is reported **uncovered with a reason**, never guessed
    at. `protocol/list-for-entity` is that shape and stays as it is — an engine cannot know its
    callers' nouns, which is the separate half of #890 (see the follow-up issue).

  **What the kit does with it.** An `entityFrom` operation is driven **once per admissible type**,
  so Callout's timeline now runs its pair over a work order _and_ over a protocol — 2 new generated
  tests per vertical, all passing, so the handlers were honouring both all along. The kit also reads
  a single-valued literal off the schema rather than being handed it: the three fixtures each
  restated their constant in `inputs`, a second copy that could disagree with the declaration, and
  Handlebar's was quietly deciding that only repairs got tested.

  Meridian's `hr/timeline` is the one-type case and keeps `entity: 'employee'`, with
  `z.literal('employee')` where the open string was.

  **Surface note, stated because it is a narrowing:** the three timelines now refuse an entity type
  they used to accept and answer with a validation error rather than a permission denial. No caller
  in the repo passes anything else, and the portal is unaffected — a portal customer reads her
  order's timeline as `entityType: 'workorder'` and her grant on the CUSTOMER reaches it through the
  parent walk (`workorder → facility → customer`), which is what makes the portal work. Meridian's
  `openapi.json` records the narrowing as `"const": "employee"`.

- 3ee2670: The conformance receipt: a package's entity-check claim moves where a tool can read it

  `entityCheckConformanceSuite` proves a handler honours the check its operation declared,
  and that proof runs inside vitest and vanishes with the process. `CONFORMANCE.md` (#866,
  kernel-design §11.2) needs the same facts at emit time, and a tool cannot import a test
  file — its top-level `describe` throws outside a runner.

  So the claim leaves the test file. `test/conformance.ts` exports a declaration, the test
  imports it and passes it straight through as the suite's options, and the emitter reads
  the same object. There is no second copy of `inputs` or `uncovered` to drift, which is the
  property `PERMISSIONS.md` is built on: an artifact rendered from a second copy is an
  artifact that can disagree with what runs.

  - **`@substrat-run/contract-tests/conformance`** — `declareEntityChecks`, `declareNodeOnly`
    and `assertNodeOnly`, on a subpath that imports no runner. A `declareEntityChecks` result
    _is_ an `EntityCheckSuiteOptions`, so it is passed through unchanged.
  - **`@substrat-run/contract-tests/plan`** — `planEntityCheckCoverage` split into
    `entity-check-plan.ts`, importing no runner. Its own note already argued for this
    ("exported and pure so the classification is testable on its own"); the emitter is the
    call site that made it necessary. The main entry re-exports it, so existing imports are
    unchanged.
  - **`declaredNodeOnlySuite`** — the third assessment shape, generalised out of
    `engines/invoicing`, which was the only package doing it by hand and was consequently
    read as unassessed by two fleet censuses. Stronger than `nodeOnlySuite`: it reads the
    declaration rather than grepping source, so it is exact rather than lexical. Carries the
    zero guard the hand-written version lacked, plus the assertion that distinguishes "checks
    at the node" from "checks nothing" — an operation with no check at all also produces an
    empty plan.
  - **`NodeOnlyOptions.because`** — optional, and printed into the test name. Required by
    `assertNodeOnly`, because an assessment with no reasoning is indistinguishable from
    nobody having thought about it, and the receipt prints it to a reader outside the repo.

  Additive throughout: no existing export changed shape.

- 04c61c1: kernel: the denial log gets a reader (`listDenials`, `summarizeDenials`)

  K-35 shipped the write side in both adapters four weeks ago. Every enforced `assertAllowed`
  denial in production has been recorded since — actor, permission, node, operation, `at` —
  written as a fresh autocommit _after_ the rollback that would otherwise erase the evidence
  of itself. **Nothing read it.** K-35 said so in its own last clause: the directory-side
  surfacing "rides §5.4's admin-query RPC, unbuilt". The only consumer in the repo was a
  contract test (#867).

  That left the platform's three logs two-thirds built and asymmetric: `_substrat_admin_log`
  holds staff mutations and is readable in the console, `_substrat_access_log` (K-24) holds
  staff reads, and `_substrat_denials` (K-35) held refusals for nobody. It is the log that
  matters most of the three, because it is the stronger kind of evidence. A generated
  conformance report says _"we attempted the attack in CI at commit X"_; these rows say _"on
  your data, in production, here is every refusal, by whom, against which key"_.

  **The §5.4 RPC turned out to be built.** This is its first caller in the sense the decision
  meant — two `HostAdmin` reads (`listDenials`, `summarizeDenials`), served as
  `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/denials[/summary]`, reached through the same delegation ladder as
  the table reads: a hosted scope through its vertical's platform-gated `/internal/denials`,
  a co-located one locally. Same `PlatformActorId`, same K-24 access-log entry, same K-3
  `(tenantId, scopeId)` cross-check failing closed on a mismatch. Reading the denial log is
  itself logged. The §7 bound holds unchanged: directory metadata and denial rows, never
  tenant business data.

  **Both of K-35's hedges were built rather than deferred, because both are load-bearing.**

  _Rate-bucketing._ K-35 called it sanctionable up front, and the reason is not tidiness: a
  probing client mints unlimited rows, so a newest-first page of 200 shows 200 rows from one
  prober and hides everyone else — the read fails exactly when it matters. So the bucketed
  view is the default surface, not a refinement, and it is ordered **by count**, which is what
  keeps the quiet actor on the page beside the loud one. Buckets are (actor, permission) —
  K-35's own "first occurrence + count per actor/key/window" — and carry `COUNT(DISTINCT
operation)` beside the count, because one operation refused four hundred times is a broken
  screen or a misconfigured role while the same count across a dozen is someone walking the
  surface.

  _The window is not a retention policy._ Rows drain rather than expire (K-24's split), and
  until a Tier 2 sink exists the window simply **is** the retention. So the summary reports
  the log's oldest and newest held rows computed **ignoring the filter** — a fact about the
  log, not about the query. That is what stops an empty result being read as "this never
  happened" when the truth is "we no longer hold that far back", and an empty log reports a
  null window rather than a fabricated instant.

  Both adapters answer from one shared SQL builder (`kernel/denial-query.ts`), the same shape
  `platform-request-query.ts` uses, so the pure-SQLite host and the Durable Object cannot
  drift on what "newest" means or what a bucket groups by. The filter takes the **logical**
  actor — a bare principal ULID — and normalizes to the stored `JSON.stringify` encoding, so
  no call site has to know how the writer spells it.

  Ten contract-suite tests run against both hosts, including the DO path. Three of them pin
  properties rather than plumbing: that buckets are count-ordered so a flood cannot hide a
  quiet actor, that a window bound narrows `total` and never the window, and that a bare
  `ctx.check` a module branches on writes no denial — K-35's deliberate silence, asserted
  through the read surface an operator actually sees.

  The console renders it per scope, bucketed, with the window stated in the card's own caption.

- d4c66ac: An engine declares a check narrowed to a ref the caller owns, and absence's are driven

  `engines/absence` narrows six checks to `subject: EntityRef`, and until now they were
  **undeclarable rather than undeclared** — two separate problems that had to be fixed in order.
  The format could not hold them: a narrowed check named `entity: '<a type from a declared
registry>'`, and absence narrows to Meridian's `employee`, which appears in no registry absence
  can see. #890's `entityFrom` did not reach it either — it changes where the type name comes
  from, not that it has to be a name someone declared.

  `refFrom` names the input field carrying the whole `EntityRef`. One field, both halves: the type
  travels with the id, so there is nothing left for `entity` or `idFrom` to say, and declaring
  either alongside is a compile error. A dotted path reaches one level in, for absence's `request`,
  where the erasure key rides beside the ref in `subject: { ref, dataSubjectId }`.

  **The kit drives these, and the harness plays the vertical.** A suite declares `refEntityType` —
  absence's names `employee`, a noun the engine has never heard of — and `createEntity` mints a bare
  ULID without writing a row anywhere, because a subject ref is exactly that: an opaque pointer the
  vertical owns. A grant resolves against a ref whether or not any table on the engine's side knows
  it, which is what makes the engine's indifference to the noun testable rather than merely stated.
  Without a `refEntityType` the operations are reported uncovered, never skipped.

  Driven rather than argued — `absence/balance` mutated to check the node:

  ```
  × absence/balance — absence:read on employee, ref from 'subject'
    → denied a principal holding absence:read on the very employee it was invoked against
      — the handler is checking the node, not the entity
  ```

  ## engines/absence declares its operation surface

  All eleven, in `src/operations.ts`, with `src/schemas.ts` carrying the shapes — the last of #891's
  five packages. Four checks declare `refFrom` and are driven (`request`, `balance`, `availability`,
  `list-entries`); all four were already honoured.

  **The other two narrowed checks declare node keys, and that is the finding worth reading.**
  `cancel` has two authorities and the narrowed one reads its ref off the STORED request, so there
  is no field to name; `list-requests` narrows only when the caller supplies a subject, and a
  `refFrom` on an optional field would claim a narrowing that a caller omitting it never gets. Both
  are stated in `operations.ts` rather than left to be inferred, and both are the shapes #892 already
  met in Meridian and Shop.

  **Breaking at the operation seam:** three list reads now answer `Page<T>` (#811). Meridian composes
  this engine by CALL — `requestAbsence`, `balanceAsOf`, `listEntries` — and those in-scope functions
  are unchanged, so no consumer moves. **No migration:** `absenceEntities` declares one entity, the
  ledger and the request book are rows rather than registry entities, and the leave-type read answers
  a projection — so `paged.over` has nothing to name and no list index is provisioned. The ledger's
  cursor is the `(effectiveDate, id)` pair, because `effective_date` is caller-supplied and an accrual
  dated last year may be written today; the walk is driven in a test rather than asserted as a string.

  ## engine-protocol says what it actually does

  `protocol/list-for-entity` declared `narrows`, which describes a per-row proof walk. It checks ONE
  parent and then queries. It now declares `entityFrom`, which is true, and the kit reports it
  **uncovered with a reason** — the type comes from an open `z.string()`, since an engine cannot
  enumerate its callers' nouns. That is a louder outcome than being out of scope, and it is the
  honest one: a real narrowed check that nothing is driving.

- cabd449: kernel: an entity's version is the last event's ULID (`ctx.versionOf`)

  Two users edit the same customer and the last write silently destroys the first. Nothing in
  the platform could refuse that, because nothing could say which revision of a row a caller
  had read — no entity table carries a version, and `precondition_failed` (412) has sat
  declared-but-unraisable in the error taxonomy waiting for one (#901, unblocking #129).

  **The version already existed.** `_substrat_outbox` has recorded `entity_type` and
  `entity_id` against a monotonic ULID `id` since it was written, on every event, for every
  module. Every mutation that followed the fat-event rule already versioned the thing it
  touched; nothing had ever read it back. So this adds `ctx.versionOf(ref)` — the ULID of the
  last event about an entity, or `null` if there has never been one — and an index that makes
  it a seek.

  **The rejected design is the interesting half.** This began as a `_version INTEGER` column
  on every entity table, added at the moment DDL derivation makes it cheap. That was filed as
  time-boxed and urgent, and it was the wrong shape for two reasons that are not about cost.

  The only way to make a column unforgettable is a trigger emitted per table — and a trigger
  is SQLite, replicated into ~73 tables, re-derived for every vertical authored afterwards.
  The scope-host contract is not a SQL contract; `query`/`exec` are how _these two adapters_
  happen to serve it, and a guarantee expressed as DDL cannot be honoured by an adapter that
  is not SQLite. The spine version is one method with an adapter-private implementation: same
  guarantee, no vertical carries it, no adapter is bound to SQLite to provide it. It also
  means there is no window — a spine fact is not time-boxed by DDL derivation at all, so this
  no longer gates that work.

  The ULID earns the job on four properties, each verified rather than assumed. It is
  **monotonic** (`ulid()` uses the spec's monotonic factory, which the outbox's `ORDER BY id`
  already depended on, so two events in one millisecond still compare in creation order). The
  outbox is **never pruned** — it drains, it does not expire. It **survives erasure**: a shred
  nulls `payload` and keeps the row, so an erased entity can still refuse a stale write rather
  than failing open at the worst possible moment. And it is **unforgeable**, because module
  code cannot write `_substrat_*` — a column would have needed a trigger clever enough to
  reset a forged value.

  **Two properties that are not the happy path, both pinned by the contract suite on both
  hosts.** A shred does not take the version with it. And a mutation that emits nothing does
  _not_ move it — that is the honest hole, since "every mutation emits a fat event" is
  enforced by review and not by `boundary-lint`. The answer is not a change here: it is that a
  declared `concurrency` must be compile-checked against the operation's declared `emits`
  (#129), which is strictly more than the column would have given — a trigger guarantees the
  column moved, never that the operation announced what it did.

  One behavioural difference from a per-row counter, documented at the seam rather than left
  to be discovered: **any** event about the entity moves the version, including one that
  changed nothing the caller read. A precondition built on this is conservative — it can
  refuse a write that would have been safe, and cannot admit one that would not.

  The index (`_substrat_outbox (entity_type, entity_id, id)`, `id` last so SQLite walks to the
  end of the matched range instead of aggregating over it) lands in both adapters' spine DDL,
  which is all `IF NOT EXISTS` and re-applied on every cold start — so existing scopes pick it
  up with no migration and no backfill. The outbox had no index at all before this; it was
  only ever read in drain order, which is its primary key.

- 6d71731: The host parses a declared operation input, so no handler has to

  `OperationShape.input` described itself as _"the SAME Zod object the handler parses"_. Across the
  fleet it mostly was not. Of ~85 declared inputs, 40 were parsed; `demos/rally` declared 32 and
  parsed 2; `demos/shop` declared 14 and parsed none. The declaration was true about the _shape_ —
  the compiler holds `idFrom` and `entityIdFrom` to it — and false about the parsing, which is the
  half that refuses a malformed call (#893).

  **A lint rule was the other candidate and is strictly weaker.** It can ask only whether _some_
  `.parse` appears in a handler body, never whether it is the declared schema, at the boundary,
  before the first read of a field. And it cannot be satisfied at all where the schema is declared
  inline — `demos/callout`, `demos/handlebar` and `demos/todo` declare 25 inputs as
  `input: z.object({…})` with no identifier a handler could name, and the reference implementation
  is one of them.

  So the host parses instead, from the declaration that already produces the manifest, the routes
  and the OpenAPI document:

  ```ts
  export const bookingModule: ModuleRegistration = {
    manifest: bookingManifest,
    operations: OPERATIONS,
    operationInputs: operationInputsOf(bookingOperations),
  };
  ```

  `operationInputsOf` derives name → schema; `ModuleRegistration.operationInputs` carries it; both
  adapters parse before the guards and the handler, outside the transaction. Every path in is
  covered — HTTP, a scenario test, a seed, a schedule — which is why this is not at the HTTP mount:
  parsing there alone would have left the demos' own suites exercising the one route the fix did not
  cover. `mountOperations` already made this argument for the page trio, in those words, and it is
  the argument here.

  A schema declared for an operation the module does not bind is refused at registration: a schema
  on nothing enforces nothing while reading as coverage.

  **Adopted by the four packages #893 named** — `engines/booking`, `demos/rally`, `demos/shop`,
  `demos/meridian`. The rest of the fleet is unchanged and still hand-parses or does not;
  `inputParseContractSuite` is what makes the guarantee portable once they adopt.

  ## Three things the change turned up, none of them predicted

  **1. A paged read invoked in process was handed `undefined`.** `ImplInput` types a paged
  handler's input as `… & PagedInput` with no undefined arm, because the platform supplies the page
  _"whether it declared one or not"_ — and over HTTP that was already true. In process it was not:
  `invoke('booking/list')` with no argument is the ordinary way a test or another operation reads a
  list. The empty page is now materialised in the derived schema rather than each paged handler
  learning to survive `undefined`. A required filter still fails, against `{}` and with a message
  naming the field.

  **2. `entityCheckConformanceSuite` read its fixture at collect time.** The extras a case is driven
  with were spread in the `describe` body, before `beforeAll`. A fixture entry holding a value that
  does not exist yet — rally's spare member, created in `beforeAll` and written into the object the
  kit was handed, which is the documented way to supply an id the harness must make first —
  captured the empty placeholder instead. Nothing said so: case 1 only asserts "was not denied",
  and case 2's permission answer arrived before anything looked at the field. Read per case now.

  **3. Two fixtures had never been valid.** `booking/join`'s conformance `partyRef` was 27
  characters where the declared `dataSubjectId` wants a 26-character ULID, and `demos/shop`'s
  scenario §8 reached an elapsed hold by asking for `holdSeconds: 0` — which the declared input has
  always forbidden (`.positive()`), and which is the exact thing the house rule names instead of
  `manualClock`. §8 now runs on a clock it advances, the way its own sibling `hold-expiry.test.ts`
  already did while criticising it.

  All three are the same finding in different clothes: a value nobody parsed was free to be wrong.

- 1c1f23c: A read-modify-write says what it is writing over — `concurrency`, `If-Match`, and the 412

  Two people open the same record, both save, and the second write destroys the first. No
  error, no log line, and nobody notices until the data is gone. An operation that is
  read-modify-write now declares what it is writing over:

  ```ts
  'callout/update-facility': {
    input: z.object({ facilityId: z.string(), name: z.string().optional(), … }),
    concurrency: { over: 'facility', idFrom: 'facilityId' },
    emits: { entity: 'facility', entityIdFrom: 'id', type: 'callout.facility-updated', … },
    http: { method: 'PATCH', path: '/facilities/{facilityId}' },
  }
  ```

  One declaration, three consequences. Every response carries the entity's version as an
  `ETag`. An unsafe method compares the caller's `If-Match` against that version **inside the
  operation's transaction** and refuses a stale one with `precondition_failed` (412). The
  generated browser client remembers the tag a read handed back and sends it on the next
  write to that entity, so an app writes no header code.

  No new error vocabulary: `precondition_failed` → 412 has been declared in the taxonomy
  since #113, excluded from `DOCUMENTED_ERROR_CODES` precisely so it would appear when
  something could raise it. It now joins the emitted document **per operation** — on the ones
  that declared `concurrency` and nowhere else.

  **Opt-in, and not left to memory.** Most declared operations are command-shaped:
  `todo/rename-list` takes a name, not a whole entity it read and echoed back, and two
  concurrent renames do not lose an update. But the shape that _does_ lose them is visible in
  the model — one required field naming the row, every other field optional over that
  entity's own columns — and an operation of that shape with no `concurrency` is refused at
  module load, as a bare-array list output with no `paged` already is. It matches nothing in
  the fleet today, which makes now the cheapest moment it will ever be added.

  ### Three things the implementation had to get right

  **A guarded operation must emit.** An entity's version is the ULID of the last event about
  it (#901) — there is no version column. So a guarded write that announces nothing is worse
  than an unguarded one: both writers pass their `If-Match`, neither moves the version, both
  commit, and both receive a 200 with an `ETag` asserting the write was serialised.
  `concurrency.over` is compile-checked against the operation's declared `emits`, which is
  the check `entity-version.ts` asked for by name.

  **The permission answers before the precondition.** The version is snapshotted before the
  handler (its own `emit` moves it) and compared _after_ — because the permission check lives
  inside the handler, and refusing on the version first turns any guarded operation into an
  oracle: a principal with no permission on the entity sends `If-Match: *` and learns whether
  it exists, or sends a tag and learns whether it changed. Found by driving Callout's
  two-tab scenario over real HTTP as a technician, which answered 412 where it owed 403.

  **An unacknowledged precondition is refused, not assumed.** Every previous argument added
  to the coordinator↔ScopeDO RPC was safe for an old DO to ignore — dropping
  `failureEnvelope` makes it throw, which the caller handles. Dropping `ifMatch` would commit
  the write and return 200 with nothing compared. So the DO acknowledges that it evaluated
  the header, and a coordinator that sent one and sees no acknowledgement refuses the success
  rather than reporting a conditional write that was never conditional.

  ### What each package gained

  - **contracts** — `concurrency` on `OperationShape`; `assertConcurrencyMovesVersion` and
    `assertFieldBagsDeclareConcurrency` at module load; `operationConcurrencyOf`;
    `ETAG_HEADER` / `IF_MATCH_HEADER` / `CONCURRENCY_EXPOSED_HEADERS` / `etagOf` /
    `ifMatchAdmits`; `precondition_failed` carries the refused `entity` (and deliberately not
    the current version — handing it back turns the obvious client fix into a blind retry
    that overwrites whatever caused the refusal); the OpenAPI builder emits the header, the
    `ETag` and the 412 per guarded operation.
  - **kernel** — `InvokeOptions` as the third argument to `ScopeStub.invoke`: the
    request-preconditions seam #116 will add `Idempotency-Key` to, plus the reply channel the
    mount reads the tag from. `assertIfMatch`. `ModuleRegistration.operationConcurrency`.
  - **adapter-sqlite / adapter-cloudflare** — the comparison, inside the transaction, in the
    order above; the acknowledgement across the DO hop.
  - **contract-tests** — `concurrencyContractSuite`, 13 cases both adapters pass.
  - **vertical-host** — the mount reads `If-Match` on unsafe methods only (on a `GET` the
    header means a conditional read, and forwarding it would refuse a read for being stale)
    and sets `ETag`.
  - **model-emit** — a guarded method routes through a `guarded()` runtime that keys tags by
    `entityType:id`, evicts on a 412 rather than replacing (auto-retrying with the new tag
    would overwrite the change that caused the refusal), and exposes the map as
    `client.versions`. A client with no guarded operation is byte-identical to before.

  ### Callout adopts it, and adopting it found a bug

  `callout/update-facility` is the fleet's first guarded operation, with
  `callout/get-facility` beside it as the read that hands out the tag — without one, the
  guard is unreachable, since a client could only acquire a tag by writing.

  `callout/create-facility` had never emitted an event. Nothing caught it, because "every
  mutation emits a fat event" is enforced by review rather than by `boundary-lint`. The
  consequence only became visible here: a facility created by a silent write has no version
  at all, so every conditional update against it is refused forever, against a tag the caller
  was never given. It emits `callout.facility-created` now.

  Callout's conformance receipt goes from 1 narrowed check to 3, all driven.

- b3c362d: contracts: a parse failure carries its fields across the ScopeDO hop

  `PROBLEM_EXTENSIONS.validation_failed` has always declared an `errors` member, and
  `validationIssuesFrom` has always existed to build it. Nothing populated it on the way
  out, so field-level issues survived only as JSON **inside the message string** and every
  vertical that wanted them wrote the same `fromZod()` that re-parses that string (#831).

  **#893 is what made this load-bearing rather than cosmetic.** The host now parses a
  declared operation input at the scope door, so the two adapters lose the answer
  differently:

  - under `adapter-sqlite` the refusal throws in-process and the `ZodError` arrives with
    `issues` intact;
  - under `adapter-cloudflare` it is raised _inside_ the ScopeDO and crosses the hop, where
    a throw carries only its message. `toWireFailure` copied `SubstratError.extensions` —
    which a `ZodError` does not have — so the field list was dropped at the one seam it had
    to cross.

  Structured in a scenario test and bare in production is the worst of the two available
  failures, and it is the shape that hides: the code was right (`validation_failed`), the
  status was right (400), and only the half a client actually acts on was missing.

  - **`toWireFailure` maps `issues` onto the declared `errors` extension**, so
    `fromWireFailure` → `toProblem` round-trips a parse failure with its fields on both
    substrates. A throw that already carries `errors` is left alone.
  - **`toProblem` reads a parse failure by SHAPE, not `instanceof`** — the doctrine
    `errorCodeOf` and `vertical-host`'s `isParseFailure` already follow, for the reason
    this module states about two copies of a library in one build. `instanceof z.ZodError`
    silently produced a fieldless body for a duplicate zod copy.
  - **A parse failure gets the canonical `detail`** on both paths rather than the throw's
    own message. A raw `ZodError` stringifies its whole issue list into `message`; echoing
    that beside a parsed `errors` array publishes the same thing twice, in exactly the shape
    this change exists to stop clients re-parsing.

            **Scoped to parse failures, and the `errors` list is what identifies one.**
            `validation_failed` is also raised semantically — `endDate precedes startDate`
            (`engines/absence`), `invalid interval` (`engines/booking`), `at most one party may

        sign as primary` (`engines/protocol`) — where the sentence _is_ the information and no

    field list exists to put in its place. Those keep their own message, unchanged, and a
    test pins it: a canonical detail applied to all of `validation_failed` would have
    deleted seventeen useful messages across four engines to standardise a body that had
    nothing else to say.

  **The test is in `inputParseContractSuite`, not only in `contracts`.** A round-trip unit
  test passes on either adapter; it is the suite that already runs on both which can say the
  two agree. Checked by neutralising the fix: the new case is red on `adapter-cloudflare`
  and green on `adapter-sqlite` — the asymmetry, reproduced before it was closed.

  `CODE_BY_ERROR_NAME`'s comment recorded the loss as accepted (_"a parse failure crossing
  the hop loses its `issues` array"_); it now records why the `ZodError` row still earns its
  place — a prototype-less arrival, a structured clone, the legacy pre-envelope RPC path —
  rather than a loss that no longer happens.

  Not in scope: transports emitting `problem+json`. `toProblem` still has no production
  caller, `mountOperations` still decides status and not shape by design, and every vertical
  still hand-rolls its own `onError`. That is phase 4 of the error-model rollout
  (`docs/rfc/error-model.md` §5) and its own reviewable diff. What changes here is that a
  caller reaching for `toProblem` now gets the fields on every substrate instead of one.

### Minor Changes

- b2dac1e: `nodeOnlySuite` — a module that narrows nowhere says so, and can stop being true loudly

  `entityCheckConformanceSuite` reads an operation's declaration and drives the behavioural
  pair that proves the handler honours it. Seven packages in this repo have no declared
  operation surface for it to read, and they carry the failure mode #865 named: **absence
  reading as coverage**. Zero narrowed declarations is indistinguishable from nobody having
  looked, and the packages where nobody looked are the ones worth looking at.

  So a module that genuinely checks only at the node states it, wired to something that goes
  red the day that changes:

  ```ts
  nodeOnlySuite("engine-metering", {
    sources: [new URL("../src/index.ts", import.meta.url).pathname],
  });
  ```

  Its header is explicit about being a much weaker instrument than the conformance kit: it
  proves an absence rather than a behaviour, it is lexical (a check assembled indirectly is
  invisible to it), and it says nothing about whether node-only is _right_ — that judgement is
  the prose each caller writes above it. What it buys is that narrowing an operation in one of
  these packages turns the suite red, so the assessment cannot quietly become a comment that
  was true once.

### Minor Changes

- 5b7fbc0: A list read declares its filter and sort vocabulary, and the kernel composes the walk
  behind it (#811, K-41).

  K-18 promised _"engine list APIs accept registry-declared filter/sort predicates with
  correct pagination and counts, the kernel composing the join inside the scope DB"_ and
  nothing implemented it. Twelve reads across four engines and four demos answered with whole
  tables, and `engines/*` carried ~36 hand-written `ORDER BY` clauses, none of them
  caller-selectable — so a vertical wanting a different sort had no path but to fork the
  engine, which is the signal CLAUDE.md names as the engine having drawn its line wrong.

  **`paged` is now a union of two halves, not one shape with optional fields.** Declare `over`
  and the kernel composes the `WHERE`, the `ORDER BY`, the keyset comparison, the `LIMIT` and
  the matching `COUNT` from your entity's declared columns — and provisions the indexes behind
  them, which is the reason this is kernel-layer rather than a query helper in contracts. A
  declared filter with no index is a table scan that passes every test and degrades when one
  tenant's table grows. The columns are compile-checked against the entity registry, and the
  manifest fragment the kernel indexes from is _derived_ from the operations
  (`listsDeclaredBy`), the way emitted events already are.

  ```ts
  paged: {
    over: { entity: 'workorder', sortable: ['number', 'status'], filterable: ['status'] },
    order: 'desc',
  }
  ```

  ```ts
  return mapPage(
    ctx.page<OrderRow>("workorder", { ...input, filters }),
    toWorkOrder
  );
  ```

  The kernel returns rows; the projection and any hydration stay yours. This is not a
  generated-CRUD layer — it invents no routes and no handlers. Adoption also _bounded_ three
  N+1 reads: a hydration that ran once per row in the scope now runs once per row on the page.

  **The other half is not a legacy path.** Five reads cannot be kernel-composed and say so:
  `callout/timeline` walks `_substrat_outbox` (a kernel table, not a registry entity),
  `protocol/list-templates` selects through a correlated `MAX(version)` subquery, and three
  portal reads decide visibility by a per-row proof walk. They declare `sortKey`, own their
  `WHERE`, and still page. `pageVisible` is the helper for the permission-filtered case: it
  over-fetches and advances the cursor by the last row **examined**, so rows the walk rejects
  still move it forward. Its pages may come back short, and a short page does not end the
  walk — only the absent `Link` does.

  **Every kernel-composed walk carries a tie-break.** A keyset over a non-unique column drops
  rows — `status > 'open'` excludes its own ties — so the walk runs over `(sortColumn, id)`
  and the cursor is the `|`-joined composite `pagination.ts` had already pinned with nothing
  producing one. That is also why `over.entity` is pointable-only.

  **The gate.** `defineOperations` refuses at module load an operation whose `output` is a bare
  `z.array(...)` with no `paged`. #811 asked for a `lint:model` gate; a tool has to _find_ the
  declarations, and the ones it would have missed are exactly the four engines this issue was
  filed about. At load it reaches every module, and it immediately found two unbounded reads a
  hand survey had missed.

  **The platform supplies the page.** `mountOperations` parses `limit`/`cursor`/`order`/`sort`
  with the one shared schema and merges them into the input, so the default page size and the
  `LIST_PAGE_MAX` ceiling are true of the surface rather than of the operations whose author
  remembered to restate them. An over-limit request is refused, not silently capped — a caller
  handed 200 of the 100 000 they asked for cannot tell a capped page from the end of a walk.

  **Breaking, in process only** — `minor` rather than `major` because these engines are 0.x,
  where semver puts a breaking change, and because `major` would mint 1.0.0 and claim a
  stability milestone the fleet has not declared. The break is stated here instead.

  `workorder/list`, `invoicing/list`, `protocol/list-templates` and
  `protocol/list-for-entity` now return `Page<T>` instead of `T[]`, and
  `listOrders(ctx, status?)` becomes `listOrders(ctx, page)`. Every call site is a compile
  error, which is how all twelve conversions were found. It is **not** a wire break: #829 moved
  the walk to `Link`/`X-Total-Count` headers, so a paged read's HTTP body is still the entries
  array. `getWorkOrder(ctx, orderId)` is new — added because paging exposed two verticals
  reading every row in the scope to `.find` one.

- 892d611: Module code gets a clock, and loses the wall clock (#812).

  `OperationContext` had no way to ask what time it was, so module code reached past the
  kernel for one: 95 hand-rolled `new Date()` / `Date.now()` calls across `engines/*` and
  `demos/*`, stamping rows the host could not see. Meanwhile `contracts/ids.ts` described
  the `instant` brand as "stamped kernel-side, never caller-side" — true of events, false
  of every domain row in the repo.

  `ctx.now(): Instant` is that clock, and `boundary-lint` **R6** is what keeps it the only
  one — the same class of ban as R2's `node:*`, and shipped in `@substrat-run/boundary-lint`
  so it enforces on generated and third-party verticals too.

  **It is stable for the whole invocation.** Every call within one operation returns the
  same instant, so two rows written in one transaction cannot disagree about when they were
  written, and an event carries the same instant as the row it describes. That is a promise
  about the value, not an optimisation: it is what a frozen clock rests on. Both hosts stamp
  it once when the context is built, and route `emit`'s `occurredAt` and `requestPlatform`'s
  `requested_at` through the same value.

  **The point is what becomes testable.** The host takes a `clock` (the same seam as
  `fetch`), and `manualClock` / `frozenClock` ship from the kernel. `demos/shop` has the
  worked example: its scenario suite already "covered" hold expiry by passing
  `holdSeconds: 0`, which proves an already-expired hold is swept and nothing about expiry.
  The new `test/hold-expiry.test.ts` holds a unit for its real fifteen minutes, asserts it is
  still reserved at fourteen, and gone at sixteen — with no real time elapsed.

  R6 has a reviewable `boundary-lint-allow R6` … `boundary-lint-end R6` block, because
  unlike R5's one-time handoff there is a recurring legitimate case: a timestamp a _remote_
  clock judges. The three uses in `apps/dashboard` are a GitHub App JWT's `iat`/`exp` and
  two `capturedAt` provenance stamps in host-driving code that has no operation to borrow an
  instant from.

  Timestamps are pinned to ISO 8601 text. The issue expected drift to migrate here; on
  inspection there was none in module code — every Substrat table already stores ISO text,
  and the epoch integers are Better Auth's own schema in `demos/auth-server`, which is that
  library's storage contract rather than ours. Recorded rather than migrated.

- 946dd47: A delivery refused before egress stops being captioned as the provider's refusal.

  A `connector:<provider>` dispatch crosses two authorities. On the way to the bytes it calls back
  into the VERTICAL — opening the bound attachment, invoking the return-path operation — and that
  call is checked against the connection's grants. Only once those pass does anything reach the
  provider. Both ends refuse by throwing, both landed in the same `lastError` string, and nothing
  recorded which was which.

  So the drain asked `isTerminalProviderError`, which reads a bare numeric `status` — and every
  `SubstratError` carries one from the problem catalog. A `permission denied: protocol:read` raised
  inside the vertical answered `true`, and the delivery was journaled as _"a client error the
  provider will refuse identically on retry"_. Scrive never received that request. The integration
  drawer then captioned it _"what Scrive said, in full"_, and directly above it rendered the grant
  list that did not contain `protocol:read` — both halves of the diagnosis on one screen, inches
  apart, with nothing saying one was the other's answer. The operator went to audit their Scrive
  account, pressed **Test connection** (which passes, because the credential is fine), and concluded
  the platform was broken.

  ## Terminality and attribution are different questions

  `isTerminalDispatchFailure` decides whether to retry and is deliberately blind to who refused: our
  own `validation_failed` is as final as the provider's 409, and both statuses come from the same
  structural read. `isTerminalProviderError` now answers only "may this be quoted as the provider's
  words", and one of ours never may.

  **No delivery changed its retry behaviour.** That part was never wrong, and moving it would have
  been a silent semantics change smuggled into a bug fix — a permission denial still settles terminal
  on the first attempt rather than burning a hundred drain passes. What changed is what is _said_
  about it.

  ## The attribution is a value, not a sentence

  `PlatformRequestFailure` (`origin`, `code`, `permission`) is journaled beside `lastError` in the
  scope's own spine, so no reader parses prose to learn who refused. `origin: 'unknown'` is a real
  answer — a socket that never opened is not the provider's refusal either — and NULL is a different
  fact again: nobody classified this row, rather than somebody classifying it as unattributable. The
  column is additive and nullable, so an intent settled by an older control plane reads as
  unrecorded rather than acquiring an origin nobody decided.

  ## A `ControlPlaneError` is always ours

  It is constructed in exactly one place — a call _we_ made to the vertical's `/internal` surface came
  back non-2xx — so whatever status it carries is the vertical's answer to the platform, never the
  provider's to us. This is the rule that fixes the reported failure, and it is why the correction
  lands in the control plane alone: a 403 raised by a deployment that predates this change is still
  attributed correctly, with no vertical redeploy in the path.

  The permission key is read from the structured field when it survived the hop, and recovered from
  the kernel-authored `permission denied: <key>` message when it did not — applied ONLY to a failure
  already attributed to us, so a provider echoing the phrase can never be re-read as our own refusal.
  Nothing parses prose to decide the origin.

  ## The drawer joins what it was already rendering

  A failed delivery naming a permission absent from the connection's live grants now says so where
  the failure is. When the key IS held the sentence is deliberately not written — that is a different
  bug, and guessing at it would rebuild the wall this removes. The panel-level caption no longer
  claims the provider's voice for deliveries it cannot attribute; it says less instead of guessing.

  **Permission diff:** none. No permission key, role or grant changes.

  **Migration diff:** one nullable spine column (`_substrat_platform_requests.last_failure`), added by
  the same attempt-and-tolerate `ALTER` both adapters already use for `authorization` and
  `revoked_at`. No module migration. The pending-intent read in both adapters also adopts
  `PLATFORM_REQUEST_COLUMNS`, which it had duplicated — that duplication is what the constant exists
  to prevent, and it drifted the moment a column was added.

  Closes #841 steps 1 and 2. Step 3 was declined with #726 (the repair is a reconcile, not a button)
  and step 4 shipped there as `lint:connector-grants`.

### Minor Changes

- ca3377d: A connection's grants become readable, and a connector's per-dispatch read stops being a standing one.

  Every other authority in this model is inspectable from where a vertical sits: the permission
  surface is diffed at promote, role tuples are readable from the scope, entitlements and identity
  links are projected and read back locally. A connection's grants were the exception — write-only
  from the deployment, readable only with staff access to the control plane — and they are the
  authority behind the one actor that is not a person.

  That blind spot has a cost on the record. `protocol:attach` was missing from a live Scrive
  connection for months, failing the sealed-copy landing into a `skipped` reason nobody reads, on
  a path whose whole purpose is to bring a legal signature home. It was found by a human reading a
  diff on an unrelated PR (#716). There was no read that could have surfaced it and no alarm that
  would have.

  ## The read

  `ScopeHost.connectionGrantsInScope(tenantId, scopeId)` answers from the scope's **own delivered
  tuples** — the rows the permission checker itself walks — so what it returns is what would
  actually be enforced there, including a scope whose delivery is behind the directory. The
  directory's view is a different fact and stays on `HostAdmin`. `conn.grants()` narrows it to one
  connection inside a dispatch, so a connector can assert its preconditions at the top of a
  delivery instead of meeting a missing grant as a refusal several calls later.

  Both tuple stores are read, and getting that wrong was the near-miss. A scope check consults
  tenant-level tuples too (rule-2 inheritance), and the two adapters split them differently: the
  pure adapter keeps tenant-wide grants in the directory, while a Cloudflare scope holds _projected_
  tenant tuples in its DO and _live_ ones in the control plane. Reading only the scope's own table
  reports a tenant-wide grant absent while it is being enforced — a read-back that disagrees with
  the checker is worse than none, because it is the read an operator would believe. The contract
  suite pins the agreement against real evaluation via the probe operation, not against the rows
  the query happened to select.

  ## The per-dispatch capability (#726 remedy B)

  The check site is entity-aware and the grant site is not. `attachments.open` asks
  `ctx.check(gate.read, { entityType, entityId })`; `connectionGrant.node` is `{ tenantId, scopeId }`
  with no entity leg, so a connection could only ever hold a permission scope-wide. The narrow
  question was being answered by the one model that could not answer it narrowly.

  And the read a signing connector makes is per-dispatch by nature. The event names one
  `documentAttachmentId`; `bindDocument` already refuses to bind an attachment owned by anything
  but the instance being signed; `openAttachment` takes an id rather than a search. So the
  authority becomes the delivery:

  > A connector dispatch may open attachments owned by the entity the delivered event names.

  Nothing new had to be invented to carry it — both facts were already kernel-stamped, and both
  adapters already tracked the delivery as ambient dispatch state (`causedBy`). The entity is
  **derived, never asserted by the caller**: what crosses the hosted `/internal` seam is an event
  id the serving deployment resolves against its own outbox. The platform runs the connector and
  can name any delivery; it cannot name an entity.

  There is no fallback to the permission check, on either a mismatch or an unresolvable id.
  "We could not resolve the delivery, so check the grant instead" is how a narrowing becomes a
  no-op — and a grant would re-widen exactly what this narrows, since `protocol:read` is not a
  keyhole: it also gates `protocol/get`, `list-templates` and `list-for-entity`, none of which a
  connector sending one named document reaches.

  `protocol:read` accordingly leaves the dashboard's Scrive catalog. There is no grant to hold, so
  there is none to miss.

  ## The declaration, and the gate that makes it load-bearing

  Three lists described one fact and nothing checked that they agreed: the connector declared what
  it needed in prose, the dashboard's catalog hardcoded what it would grant, and a vertical passed
  a third list with its own upsert. They did disagree — the catalog still read
  `['protocol:record-signature', 'protocol:attach']` after connector-scrive 0.9.0 shipped needing
  more, so no tenant connecting through the dashboard could be granted what the connector
  required, and that surfaced as an avtal failing to reach Scrive (#841).

  `SCRIVE_CONNECTION_GRANTS` puts the requirement where the knowledge is. `pnpm
lint:connector-grants` (new CI step) fails when no dashboard door can carry one. Standing grants
  only, deliberately: per-dispatch reads are authorized by the delivery now, so they belong in
  neither list; what remains is the return path, which runs top-level with no delivered event
  behind it. It checks a floor rather than an equality, so tightening a connector's needs never
  reds the repo on a stale extra.

  ## What did NOT get built, and why

  No grant-only write route — a button adding a missing grant without re-submitting a working
  credential. It is declined and recorded in `connections.md` §3.5.2: it would hand-patch drift a
  declaration should prevent, put the repair in a console nobody diffs, and ask a tenant to decide
  something that is the vertical's requirement rather than their choice. §3.5.1's law then holds by
  construction — there is no act to launder if there is no act.

  What replaces it is **not in this change**, and the doc says so rather than implying otherwise.
  The right repair is reconcile-to-target — compute the grant set from the declaration, then grant
  and revoke directory rows to match, exactly as `setEntitlementsHandler` already does for a managed
  tenant's entitlements — after which a missing grant is fixed by a push. Today the reconcile only
  delivers grants that ALREADY exist as directory rows (`listConnectionGrants`); it creates none. So
  an existing connection missing a standing grant is now _visible_ and still repairable only through
  the credential upsert. Closed here: the per-dispatch read needs no grant at all, a NEW connection
  gets what the connector declares, and a declaration no door can carry is a red.

  ## Three tests changed behaviour rather than breaking

  That change is the substance, so each was rewritten to pin the new rule from both sides rather
  than deleted:

  - The connector sends the bound document **holding no read grant at all** — and refuses an
    attachment the delivery does not name **while holding the key**.
  - The invariant those tests were really protecting — send NOTHING rather than the wrong paper —
    moves onto the failure that can still happen: a binding whose bytes are gone still
    dead-letters rather than substituting the attestation sheet.
  - The `/internal` seam test now asserts the delivery is carried through, because a dropped
    `eventId` would silently fall back to the grant check — which looks like it works, right up
    until the grant is the one that was removed.

### Minor Changes

- 9cfb99d: Search: `searchables` becomes an index the kernel builds, and `ctx.search` reads (#827).

  `manifest.searchables` has been in the contract since the beginning and nothing read it —
  `kernel-design.md` deferred the backend decision "to first search consumer", so the
  declaration was checked, linted and inert. Every search in the repo was a client-side
  `includes` over a whole list, which is correct at forty rows and wrong at forty thousand —
  and paged reads (#811) take that fallback away, because filtering a page in the browser
  searches the first page only.

  A vertical declares what is searchable, through the same helper that already checks the
  fields against its entity registry:

  ```ts
  ...manifestEntities(calloutEntities, {
    searchables: [
      { entityType: 'customer', fields: ['name', 'number'] },
      { entityType: 'note', fields: ['body'], tokenizer: 'substring' },
    ],
  }),
  ```

  From that, the kernel derives a per-scope FTS5 index and the triggers that maintain it,
  journaled like any other migration — the version _is_ the declaration
  (`search/customer:prefix:name+number`), so a changed declaration re-runs and shows up in the
  migration diff a human reads. `ctx.search(entityType, term, { limit })` returns ids and
  ranks; the caller hydrates them through the read path it already has.

  Four decisions worth knowing:

  - **Triggers, not the event spine.** The index is correct no matter who writes the row, no
    module gains a write path, and the read is read-after-write correct — a customer created
    in one breath is findable in the next. Indexing off events would have inherited the
    "don't use search for read-after-write flows" caveat for nothing.
  - **Capped, not paged.** A relevance order has no stable sort key and therefore no honest
    cursor; the result set is capped and the caller narrows the term. Ordered paging stays
    what a declared sort on a list read is for.
  - **Two tokenizers, declared per entity.** `prefix` (unicode61 + prefix index) by default;
    `substring` (trigram) opt-in, matching inside a word for a larger index. Terms below the
    index's floor are refused rather than answered by a scan.
  - **The index never enters a dump.** Export skips it and its shadow tables — they cannot be
    replayed, and D1's own exporter refuses a database that merely contains an fts5 table —
    and import rebuilds it from the content tables it loaded. A fork searches immediately,
    with its triggers intact.

  `OperationContext` gains `search`, and both hosts implement it against the shared contract
  suite. `splitSqlStatements` learned that a trigger body's semicolons are not top level — the
  derived DDL is the first thing in the repo to emit a trigger, and it passed on better-sqlite3
  (one `exec`, whole blob) while failing every scope on the Durable Object host.

### Minor Changes

- 89c2113: `ctx.atomic` — engine calls can now be sub-transactions, so catching one is safe (#770).

  A vertical composes engine in-scope functions inside ONE scope transaction, and the adapter
  rolled back only when the whole handler threw. So a vertical that did the reasonable thing —
  catch a `completeWorkOrder` failure, fall back to a manual path — was sitting on the engine's
  partial writes and committed them. Those are precisely the rows the engine's invariants exist
  to protect, which makes it the one place partial state is least acceptable. The only correct
  advice was "never catch an engine error": a convention, in the one category this platform
  normally answers with a mechanism.

  ```ts
  try {
    await ctx.atomic(() => completeWorkOrder(ctx, { orderId, billable }));
  } catch {
    // the engine's rows, events, links, grants and platform intents are all gone;
    // your own writes survive, and it still commits once
  }
  ```

  **Every semantic lives in the kernel.** A scope host supplies one method — `runSub(depth, fn)`
  — and `createAtomic` owns the depth stack, the interleaving guard, the unwrapped rethrow, and
  the restore of two tallies the storage rollback cannot reach. That split is for the third
  adapter: a Postgres or Kubernetes host writes three SQL statements and inherits the rest.
  `runSub` is closure-shaped because the Durable Object primitive _is_ a closure and forbids
  `SAVEPOINT` outright — the two hosts share a contract, never an implementation.

  The subtle half is what does not roll back on its own. The K-34 `passed` accumulator lives in
  JavaScript, so a check that passed inside a discarded region would have ridden out on the next
  event — the audit spine attributing a permission check to an event whose operation threw that
  work away, with nothing raised and the event well-formed. The #458 platform-request tally
  leaked the same way and kicked a drain for intents that never survived. Both are restored now.

  Also a portability fix. "Catch an engine error and keep going" meant three different things
  across the substrates this project claims: SQLite committed the partial writes, the DO host did
  the same, and Postgres poisons the transaction outright (`25P02`) so the operation dies at the
  next statement. `ctx.atomic` gives it one meaning, and `@substrat-run/contract-tests` now ships
  `atomicContractSuite` — twelve cases both adapters pass unchanged, including the Postgres-shaped
  one (a caught _storage_ error leaves the transaction usable) that no existing suite could express.

  Design note: `docs/rfc/sub-transactions.md`.

### Minor Changes

- da69ef5: A conformance kit that catches a node check where an entity check was declared.

  An operation declaring `permission: { key, entity, idFrom }` beside a handler
  calling `ctx.check(perm)` typechecks perfectly and fails open — everyone holding
  the key anywhere in the scope passes, which in a sharing app is every member
  against every record. `entityCheckConformanceSuite` generates the behavioural
  pair that separates the two, per operation, read off the declaration:

  ```ts
  entityCheckConformanceSuite("todo", todoOperations, makeFixture, {
    inputs: { "todo/rename-list": { name: "renamed" } },
    uncovered: {
      "todo/set-item-done": "declares 'resolved' — the id is not in the input",
    },
  });
  ```

  Grant on entity A and invoke against A: a correct check allows, a node check
  denies, because a narrowed grant does not widen. Grant on A and invoke against B:
  a correct check denies. The second is the breach direction; the first is the one
  that catches the node check, and it fails as a _baffling denial_ rather than as a
  breach — the direction nobody files a security bug about. Case 2 deliberately
  does not catch the node check, and the suite says so rather than implying
  coverage it does not have.

  Operations the kit cannot generate — a `resolved` check, or one whose required
  input nobody supplied — are reported as uncovered and asserted against a list the
  caller writes down, so losing coverage turns CI red and appears in the diff.
  `planEntityCheckCoverage` is exported for anyone who wants the partition without
  the suite.

  `alsoGrant` records the permissions an operation needs beyond the one it
  declares, with a required reason. The first vertical it ran against produced one:
  a handler that delegates a permission via `ctx.grant` must itself hold the
  permission it delegates, so the declared key is the gate it opens with rather
  than the whole authority it exercises.

  Closes #747.

- 3b8533d: **zod is now a peer dependency.** Install it alongside these packages:

  ```sh
  npm install zod@^4.4.0
  ```

  Every package here hands out zod schemas that a consumer parses with, composes
  into their own, and that `mountOperations` reads `_zod.def` off to find pinned
  literals. Two copies of zod in one tree means an object made by one is not
  recognised by the other, and the symptom — `expected a Zod schema` — points
  nowhere near the cause. A peer dependency says _use the consumer's copy_.

  The declared range is `^4.4.0` rather than the exact version this repo builds
  against: a peer range should state what the code supports, and pinning it to
  `^4.4.3` would refuse a consumer on 4.4.0 for no reason.

  **A defect this found.** `@substrat-run/contract-tests` shipped **130
  `import("zod")` references in its published `.d.ts` while declaring zod
  nowhere.** It resolved only because contracts had zod as a regular dependency,
  which hoisted a copy into view — not a dependency, a coincidence. It now declares
  it. Two more of the same class turned up when the tree shifted: packages using
  `setTimeout`/`atob`/`btoa` — globals absent from `lib: ES2023` — compiling on an
  ambient `@types/node` nobody had declared.

  That is the general rule now enforced by `pnpm lint:deps`
  (`tools/declared-deps.mjs`) in CI: **every module a package references, in its
  source or its emitted `.d.ts`, must be one it declared.** The `.d.ts` half is the
  sharp one — TypeScript writes the original specifier into declarations however
  the source imported it, so re-exporting `z` through contracts still emits
  `import("zod")` into a dependent's types.

  **Why a lint rather than pnpm's own enforcement**, measured rather than assumed:
  `autoInstallPeers` (pnpm's default) turns a peer conflict into a silent second
  copy — with contracts peer-requiring `^4.4.3` and a consumer declaring `^3.23.0`,
  pnpm reported nothing, and `zod` did not appear once in the peer report even
  under `--strict-peer-dependencies`. And pnpm's peer checking does not reach
  `workspace:` links at all. Full reasoning in `docs/architecture/dependency-policy.md`.

  Internally, shared versions now come from a pnpm `catalog:` so one version is a
  single edit. The `pnpm` settings block moved from `package.json` to
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which is where pnpm 10 reads it — it had been ignored,
  with `overrides` surviving only because they were baked into the lockfile.

  Closes #742.

### Minor Changes

- f869541: `ctx.grant` / `ctx.revoke` — an operation may narrow a permission it holds onto
  one entity.

  Every entity-narrowed grant in the fleet is made at seed time by
  `HostAdmin.grant`, a platform actor's verb. So an app where a _person_ shares
  their own record with someone had no supported mechanism: `OperationContext`
  offered `check`, `link` and `emit`, and nothing that could widen access at
  runtime. The only way to ship such a feature was a membership table consulted by
  hand in every handler — the forgotten-WHERE-clause failure this platform exists
  to remove, reintroduced one vertical at a time.

  Found by building a vertical forward from its model rather than converting one
  that already existed: the todo demo's sharing feature is unbuildable without it,
  and no existing demo could reveal the gap because all of their entity-narrowed
  access is seeded.

  Non-escalating by construction:

  - **Entity-narrowed only.** `entity` is required, so module code can never write
    a scope-wide or tenant-wide grant.
  - **Delegation, never elevation.** The caller's own decision on that entity is
    re-checked inside the verb, so an operation can only hand out what it was
    itself given.

  Transactional with the operation, like rows and events: a grant made by an
  operation that then throws never happened.

  Pinned by five contract-suite cases both adapters run — the happy path, that the
  grant reaches that entity and nothing else, the refused elevation, a control
  proving a permission the caller _does_ hold still grants, and revoke. The
  refusal case is mutation-checked: removing the guard fails it.

- 9208b4e: A signature request can carry **how a party is reached** — sealed to the
  connector, never readable in the spine (#687 item 1,
  `docs/architecture/signature-contact-carrier.md`).

  Every external signature this platform has ever sent has failed. The reason was
  not the auth level and never was: `connector-scrive` mapped each party to a role
  label — "Beställare" — and no address, so Scrive answered
  `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` and a document started with nobody to deliver
  it to. `ScriveParty.email` was declared, wired into the provider's `fields`
  array, and filled by nothing. This is its producer.

  **Why it took a design.** The obvious carrier — put the address on the event —
  is unavailable: `protocol.signatures-requested` lands in `_substrat_outbox` and
  `_substrat_platform_requests`, kernel rows a vertical may neither write nor
  erase, so anything a hosted vertical emits in plaintext stays plaintext in copies
  it cannot reach. The next obvious one — seal it under the per-subject keys — is
  impossible rather than merely awkward: those keys live in the directory, and a
  sandbox-clean vertical is architecturally on the far side of that boundary
  (§2 of the design derives it). And reading the contact back at egress deadlocks,
  because a connector runs _inside_ the scope's dispatch and re-entering the scope
  actor wedges it.

  What works is the gap in the middle: a scope may never hold a _secret_ key, and
  nothing says that about a _public_ one.

  - **`sealTo` / `openSealed` in the kernel** — the asymmetric sibling of
    `SecretBox`: ECDH P-256 → AES-256-GCM, a fresh ephemeral keypair per seal, and
    an envelope that is a `SealedSecret` so it carries `keyId`. A cell that cannot
    name its key can only ever have one, and every ciphertext already written
    becomes ambiguous the day a second exists. Rotation is deferred; the envelope
    that permits it is not.
  - **A keypair per connection.** The private half is sealed under the host
    `SecretBox` beside the credential and stored **keyId-indexed from day one**,
    even holding one member — widening a column into a set later is a migration
    against live connections. Minted on first ask, so a connection older than this
    feature acquires one by being asked rather than by being reconnected.
  - **The public half is projected into the scope**, on the channel that already
    carries entitlements, identity links and connection grants — not
    `configureInstance`, because a key in the config bag becomes a key in a
    settings form.
  - **`ctx.sealToConnection(provider, plaintext)`** — awaited _before_ `ctx.emit`,
    so `emit` stays synchronous and D-28 is untouched. **Fails closed and legibly**
    when no key has reached the scope: emitting a request with its addresses
    silently dropped is the invisible failure this exists to end.
  - **`conn.unseal(cell)`** at egress, on the connection for the same reason
    `fetch` and `openAttachment` are — key material never crosses into connector
    code.

  `engine-protocol` gains `partyContact { email?, mobile? }` on
  `signatureRequestParty` and migration `0005-party-contact`, which stores **only
  the ciphertext**. There is no plaintext column to clear later and no erasure
  story to write: the address is unreadable to the spine, to its backups and to
  `sealDump`'s output, because the key that opens it is in the directory.
  `piiClass` therefore stays `'none'` — see the migration's own note for why
  `'pseudonymous'` would be actively wrong rather than more honest.

  **No `personalNumber` field, and its absence is the decision.** #687 measured the
  premise and it is false: what a provider validates is that a BankID party _has_
  the field, not that it holds a value. An optional PII field on an engine surface
  is a carrier that exists.

  Two invariants ship with the carrier, both in `requestSignatures`, both refusing
  before anything freezes:

  - **A party that will be invited must be reachable.** Otherwise the provider
    refuses after the instance has already frozen, leaving an avtal that looks sent
    for signature and is not.
  - **A set with no counterparty is refused.** "The declared primary, else the
    FIRST" is a total function, so a one-party request never failed here — it
    failed at the provider, where that party had been made the _author_, and an
    author is never invited. In production that party was the customer.

  Verified against the Scrive **testbed**, not only the mock: a party carrying an
  address no longer draws `invalid_invitation_delivery_info` at either auth level,
  and a document with one starts and reaches `pending`. The connector tolerates an
  absent contact in both skew directions — an older engine sends none, an older
  connector strips the field — so neither combination is worse than today, which is
  that nothing works.

- 954668b: Install grants an entitlement key the manifest can actually match, and a denied operation names both sides of the gap.

  **The fallback emitted an illegal key.** `installEntitlements` derives from the
  vertical's slug when nothing is declared — but a builder-pushed vertical's
  registry slug is workspace-prefixed (`t-0wv2mwk4j5/crm-eff`), while
  `manifest.entitlementKey` is `/^[a-z0-9-]+$/`. A slash is not a legal key, so
  the fallback produced a value the thing it claims to derive from can never
  equal: for a pushed vertical the granted and required keys could not agree, by
  construction. The gate reads `manifest.entitlementKey` directly, so every gated
  operation denied. The fallback now takes the slug's bare last segment, which
  repairs already-pushed verticals on their next install without a re-push.

  The mismatch was invisible until it wasn't. An un-projected scope trusts
  upstream; the flip to strict enforcement is one-way and fires on the _first_
  projection carrying entitlements — a fan-out, a reconcile, a re-provision. So a
  bad key planted at install detonates arbitrarily later, triggered by something
  unrelated to installing. That is what made the 2026-08-15 Egeryds prod lockout
  read as a sudden platform failure rather than a four-month-old typo.

  **The denial now names required AND held keys**, expired ones marked, via a
  shared `entitlementDenial()` in the kernel so the three gates (coordinator,
  scope DO, SQLite adapter) cannot word it differently. Required-alone reads as
  "buy the SKU" and sends an operator shopping; the Egeryds tenant _held_ four
  keys, just under names the manifest could never match, and required-vs-held
  shows that near-miss at a glance. Marking expiry separates "you had it, it
  lapsed" from "you never had it" — different fixes. The extra read happens only
  on the failure path; the hot path is unchanged.

  Not changed: a required key going ungranted still does not fail the install. A
  composed engine's key being absent is a legitimate SKU gate — a tenant on
  workorder but not absence is a valid state — and the platform cannot tell that
  apart from the vertical's own key being missing.

  A vertical whose `entitlementKey` diverges from its slug must still declare
  `substrat.entitlements` in package.json; the manifest never reaches the control
  plane, so no derivation can guess it. That escape hatch is now documented in
  marketplace-publish.md, along with the fact that every engine a vertical
  composes adds a key.

- c19e371: fix: a connector failure is readable, and a refused request is no longer retried for two days

  The console's card for a broken Scrive connection said, in full: `Error · scrive · Last error 7m
ago: HTTP 409 from scrive`. The real message was nine words longer and contained the whole
  answer — `Authentication to sign for participant #1 requires valid personal number field`. It
  was journaled correctly by `settlePlatformRequest` and retained; it was simply not reachable
  from anywhere a builder would look. Getting at it meant the read-only SQL console with system
  tables toggled on, or a break-glass `scope pull --full`.

  It cost a production tenant a fortnight. Three signature requests, none of which ever reached a
  counterparty: two `failed` after **100 attempts over two days**, one still `pending` at 78 and
  counting — all on the same permanent client error. The contracts sat in `pending_signature`
  throughout, and the app had nothing to tell the user.

  - **The intent journal is readable.** `_substrat_platform_requests` had one reader,
    `listPlatformRequests`, which returns only `pending` rows — so a _settled_ intent, the only
    kind that holds an answer, was invisible by construction. Its complement,
    `ScopeHost.listPlatformRequestHistory` (`kind` / `status` / `limit`, newest first), is served
    through the vertical's `/internal` surface and the control plane's new
    `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/intents`, and rendered in the dashboard's integration detail as
    "Delivery attempts": id, status, attempts, timings, what was sent, and `lastError`
    **verbatim** — truncating it would rebuild the exact wall the section exists to remove.
  - **A 4xx settles terminal on the first attempt.** `pending` means _try again_, and every throw
    got it by default: right for a provider outage, wrong for a provider's refusal. A 4xx is the
    provider telling the caller its request is wrong; attempt 101 sends the identical bytes.
    `isTerminalProviderError` classifies structurally on the error's `status`, so no host imports
    a connector's error class — and 5xx, 408, 423, 425, 429 and anything with no status stay
    retryable, because a failure you cannot classify must never be settled terminally. Two days of
    silent retries becomes one settled row with the provider's own sentence on it.
  - **A terminal settle is visible to an operator.** It now lands an ops-failure row
    (`stage: 'terminal'`), the same treatment the attempt ceiling already had. A give-up and a
    refusal end the same way — nobody is coming back to the intent — so they deserve the same
    headline.
  - **A vertical can read the outcome of its own intents.** `ctx.platformRequests(filter)` is the
    read half of `ctx.requestPlatform`, which had none: an app could ask the platform to do
    something and then had no supported way to learn whether it happened. This is what lets a
    contract screen say the signing request never left, instead of showing a document that appears
    to be out for signature and is not. Read-only by construction — the kernel owns every write to
    that table.

  `ScopeHost` gained `listPlatformRequestHistory` and `OperationContext` gained
  `platformRequests`; both in-tree adapters implement them and the contract-test suite holds them.
  The 409 itself is a connector/engine gap, filed separately.

- daab0d5: feat(control-plane): the connection relay — a tenant admin connects a provider from the vertical's own UI

  `POST /internal/connections/upsert` (connections.md §3.5.2), mirroring the email relay
  (#303): a hosted CP-less vertical permission-checks the act with its own `ctx.check`,
  returns the pasted credential as a harness-side effect, and the harness POSTs it to the
  control plane, which re-derives the vertical from its own scope record (the shared
  `PLATFORM_SECRET` never says which vertical), seals the secret with the platform's
  `SecretBox`, and applies any requested `grantToConnection` grants on the calling scope.
  Upserts are keyed (tenant, vertical, provider, externalAccountRef): a live connection is
  rotated **in place**, so the connection id — and every grant tuple keyed on it — survives
  rotation, making credential rotation self-serve. Attribution follows §3.5.1 on both paths:
  `createdBy` on create, and a new additive `opts.rotatedBy` on
  `HostAdmin.updateConnectionSecret` that lands in the audit metadata on rotate — the tenant
  principal, never laundered into the platform actor. New contracts:
  `connectionRelayRequest` / `connectionRelayResult`; new export
  `relayConnectionUpsert` from `@substrat-run/control-plane-api`.

- 778f48a: Connection grants now reach scopes provisioned after the grant (#592). `grantToConnection` records each grant directory-side alongside the enforcement tuple (`_substrat_connection_grants`, tombstoned by `revokeConnection`'s cascade, readable via `HostAdmin.listConnectionGrants` and `GET /tenants/:tenantId/connection-grants`), and provision/reconcile gather those rows and deliver them per scope — the same authoritative channel as entitlements (#310) and identity links (#406) — so the connector return path works on every install without a human replaying grants, and a revoked connection's grants stop being delivered.

- c1faa15: feat: every pushed version records where its code came from — git CI or a terminal

  A git-connected deploy and a `substrat push` from a terminal were
  indistinguishable on the platform: the generated deploy workflow runs the same
  CLI against the same endpoint, so the dashboard could not answer "where did the
  code this app is serving come from". Now the CLI self-reports its context with
  each push and the dashboard shows it:

  - **Contracts**: `versionOrigin` on the version record — `source: 'git' | 'cli'`
    plus `gitRepo`/`gitCommit`/`gitRef` when pushed from CI. A label, never
    authority: nothing gates on it, and a version pushed before tracking (or by an
    old CLI) reads back `null`.
  - **CLI**: `substrat push` detects the GitHub Actions runner and attaches the
    repo, commit, and branch it built from; a terminal push sends `{ source: 'cli' }`.
  - **Control plane**: the deploy route parses the field leniently — a missing or
    malformed origin must never fail a push — and both adapters store it as a
    nullable `origin_json` column on the version row.
  - **Dashboard**: an origin tag (git-branch icon + `repo@sha` linking to the
    GitHub commit, or a terminal icon + `cli`) on every version row on the
    Verticals page, in the per-app Deployments tab, and beside the app's Running
    version.

  The vertical-level `source` field is deliberately untouched: it is
  claim-at-first-push metadata, and one app legitimately receives both kinds of
  push — provenance is per version.

- b387919: feat(platform): operational failures get a durable, queryable record (#559 step 3)

  A failed deploy, install, or preview restore left no durable trace — the admin log
  audits successful mutations only (by design: it answers "who changed what", and a
  failure changed nothing), so the 2026-08-08 preview-restore incident was diagnosable
  solely from a vertical script's short-retention observability logs.

  `HostAdmin` gains `recordOpsFailure` / `listOpsFailures` over a new
  `_substrat_ops_failures` directory table (both adapters, contract-tested): actor,
  operation, stage, tenant/scope/vertical, answered status, bounded message, and the
  upstream provider's trace reference (Cloudflare's `internal error; reference = <id>`)
  extracted into its own searchable column. Retention-bounded telemetry, not evidence:
  rows self-prune on write after `OPS_FAILURE_RETENTION_DAYS` (90), so the table needs
  no cron and can never grow without bound.

  The control-plane transport records from three places — the error boundary (any
  answered 5xx except 501, including a downstream vertical's 502 passthrough), the
  deploy-upload catch (both the 502 platform-failure and the 422 bad-bundle, for the
  coming builder-facing view), and the install-provision catch after its retry is
  exhausted — and serves `GET /ops-failures` (staff-only, paged, filterable by
  vertical/tenant/operation/reference, newest first).

- fa81319: feat(platform): a data subject can finally be erased, and the backups cannot un-erase them (#37)

  `piiClass: none|pseudonymous|direct` has been enforced at the type level since the contracts
  package existed: an event that could carry PII cannot be declared without a `subjectId`, and
  the Zod message says why — _"crypto-shredding must be able to key the erasure"_. The
  classification was total by construction. The erasure it keys did not exist anywhere in
  `packages/`. `demos/hr` seeds real-shaped national IDs against a comment promising a
  mechanism nobody had built.

  **The mechanism divides the way the stores divide, not the way the data does.**

  _Tier 1 is mutable, so erasing there is redaction._ `shredSubject` nulls the payload of
  every classified spine row keyed to the subject and keeps the envelope — id, type, entity,
  `occurredAt`, and the pseudonymous `subjectId`. That is master-plan §5.3 held exactly:
  _"pseudonymous keys and transaction facts remain"_. A timeline still shows that something
  happened, to what, and when. It no longer shows who, or what was said. No cryptography is
  involved and none is wanted: sealing a live payload would break the raw-SQL timeline
  projections CLAUDE.md explicitly blesses.

  _A platform-retained copy is not mutable, so erasing there is cryptographic._ A reap backup
  is full-fidelity on purpose — _"a backup that cannot restore is a false promise"_ — which is
  precisely why `UPDATE … SET payload = NULL` can never reach one. Each subject's payloads are
  now sealed under their own key on the way into a stored copy (`sealDump`, the sibling of
  `maskDump` and the opposite discipline: lossless and keyed rather than lossy and heuristic).
  Destroying that one key reaches backwards into every copy already taken, and leaves every
  other subject in the same copy restorable.

  **Where the keys live is the guarantee, not an implementation detail.** Per-subject DEKs sit
  in the **directory**, wrapped by the host `SecretBox`, never in the scope database whose rows
  they protect — master-plan.md:316, _"GDPR erasure claims are only as credible as the key
  store's independence"_. A key restored by the same dump that restores its ciphertext would
  silently reverse every erasure the restore rolled past.

  **The tombstone is what makes it an erasure rather than a delay.** A shred keeps the key row
  with the key cleared, and the sealer refuses tombstoned subjects. Without that, the next
  backup mints a fresh key and quietly undoes the erasure — a key store that forgets who was
  erased can erase them exactly once.

  **Order inside the action is fixed: redact the live spine first, destroy the key last.** Both
  halves are idempotent and a crash between them converges on retry, so the tiebreak is which
  half-done state harms the person — a run that died after redacting leaves ciphertext nobody
  can open; destroying the key first would leave their PII in the live database while the audit
  log already claimed they were erased.

  New on `HostAdmin`, implemented by **both** adapters with the crypto factored into the kernel
  (`createSubjectKeys`) so an adapter supplies three row operations and no cipher:
  `shredSubject`, `sealSubjectPayloads`, `openSubjectPayloads`. New `shredSubject` admin action,
  carrying a receipt (`eventsRedacted`, `keyDestroyed`, `tombstoned`) as its `after`. Audited in
  **both** logs — the admin log because it is a mutation, the access log because it destroys
  evidence, and an erasure is the one action where _who asked for this to disappear_ is itself
  part of the record.

  `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/subjects/:id/shred` is staff-only and absent from
  `BUILDER_ROUTES`: a builder forwards the DSAR and the platform executes it, which is where
  hosting-and-certification.md §3 already draws the line (_"we provide extraction, they define
  scope"_).

  **Five limits ship as documentation, not as backlog** (kernel-design §13.1, closing open
  question 17's spine half). One subject per event, so _"erase Jens Palmgren from everywhere"_
  is still out of reach. Vertical-owned tables are untouched — `hr_employees.national_id` needs
  the `onSubjectErased` hook that is deliberately a separate issue. Copies already handed to a
  customer, and backups taken before sealing existed, are beyond reach. A PITR rewind restores
  the pre-redaction state. A directory restore can resurrect a key, and the admin log — the
  compliance witness, never swept — is what records which erasures must then be re-applied.

  The acceptance criterion is a round trip rather than a claim: back up a scope, shred one of
  its two subjects, read the same stored copy back, and watch that subject's payloads open to
  nothing while the other's restore intact.

### Patch Changes

- 6ecb3c9: feat(platform): the stored copies get a lifecycle, and only an operator can start the clock (#557)

  The backup buckets kept every copy forever: `scopes/` reap copies (#493) and `access-log/`
  NDJSON batches (#553) had no lifecycle rule — the one retention decision #36's closure left
  unmade. (`directory/` copies were never the gap; their 30-copy window has lived in
  `backupDirectoryIfDue` since #40.)

  **`pruneScopeBackups` / `pruneAccessLogBatches`** (control-plane-api) enforce an age window
  over their own prefix, in code rather than as an R2 bucket rule so the policy is visible in
  the repo and portable to any store. Both are conservative by construction: an object that
  cannot be dated is kept, and an access-log batch is dated by its **newest** row — never
  dropped while it still holds in-window rows. The CP worker's sweep runs them behind two new
  opt-in vars, `SCOPE_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` and `ACCESS_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`; unset — the
  default — deletes nothing, the same posture as the reap windows: the platform never deletes
  evidence on a schedule a human did not choose.

  **The drive-by #553 flagged:** `pruneAccessLog`'s admin-log row carried its payload in
  `before`, inverted from `adminLogEntry`'s contract (before = prior state, after = the
  applied payload). Both adapters now record `after: { pruned }`, matching `drainAccessLog`,
  and the contract suite pins the shape.

### Minor Changes

- 88e2efa: fix(control-plane): a push stops reading the whole fleet to warn about its own surfaces

  A `substrat push` answered `500: internal error` **after** its version had already been
  published — the bundle uploaded, the version landed admitted, and only then did the
  request die. Each CI retry burned another version label and left another admitted version
  behind for a deploy that reported failure, so a PR's three attempts produced `…-pr-30.1`,
  `.2` and `.3` and no working preview.

  The throw was in the advisory surface-drift check, which is the last thing a deploy does.
  It asked for **every hostname binding on the platform** and filtered to the pushed slug in
  JS. Two things were wrong with that, and only together do they make an outage:

  `mapHostname` read the stored cert-validation records with a bare `JSON.parse`. That column
  is the one part of a hostname row this platform does not write — it is whatever the
  Cloudflare custom-hostname API returned, stored verbatim — so an unreadable blob there is a
  `SyntaxError`, which is not a `ZodError`, which `mapError` does not recognise, which is a
  blank 500. Because the read was fleet-wide, a cert detail belonging to one tenant's custom
  domain could stop an unrelated vertical from shipping, with nothing in the response saying
  so.

  So: **narrow the query, and never throw on that column.** `listHostnames` takes a
  `verticalSlug` filter, implemented in SQL by both adapters, and the deploy path asks for the
  bindings it actually wants — the rows that answer the question are now the only rows that
  can break it. `parseValidationRecords` (kernel, shared by both adapters so neither can be
  the lenient one) degrades a malformed or wrong-shaped blob to "no records". Nothing routes
  on those records; they are a copy-this-CNAME hint, and `substrat hostnames verify` re-polls
  issuance and rewrites them.

  **And the read that was never the right shape.** "The version with this id" was spelled as
  an unpaginated `listVersions(slug)` followed by `.find()` — every version a vertical ever
  published, each carrying its stored manifest, pulled across the adapter boundary to keep
  one. That cost grows once per push and lands hardest on the paths least able to afford it:
  the deploy handler's own read-back, and the router's per-request resolution of which script
  serves a scope. New `HostAdmin.getVersion(actor, versionId, verticalSlug?)`, implemented by
  both adapters, replaces nine such call sites. The optional slug preserves what
  `.find()`-inside-one-slug's-list gave for free — a version of another vertical reads as
  absent rather than being handed back across the lineage boundary.

  The retries remain non-idempotent: a push that fails after `publishVersion` still consumes
  its version label. Left alone here because making a push resumable is a design change, not
  a fix, and it is no longer reachable by this route.

- f278cc6: fix(previews): route a preview to its bound version, not the prod serving script (#527)

  A preview reported success and printed a URL that then served the promoted **prod**
  build, not the version it just pushed — so a reviewer saw their change missing and
  concluded it hadn't landed. Root cause: every scope inherited the vertical's stable
  `serving_ref` at provision (#286), and routing resolves
  `COALESCE(scope.serving_ref, version.deployment_ref)`, so a preview resolved to the
  prod serving script instead of the per-version dispatch script its data was restored
  into. Preview scopes now skip that inheritance (both adapters), so routing falls through
  to the bound version's script. Reused previews created before this fix self-heal (the
  stale `serving_ref` is cleared on re-push). Defense-in-depth: `orchestratedPreview` now
  refuses to report success for a preview that would route away from its bound version.

### Minor Changes

- 3fcf34b: Give hosted verticals a sanctioned way to send transactional mail — the resolution of the
  outbound-policy open question (#303). The sandbox deliberately keeps `send_email` off the §4
  allowlist (and a Workers-for-Platforms dispatch script cannot bind it anyway), so a vertical
  never sends directly: it POSTs to the control plane's new `POST /internal/email/send` **relay**,
  which sends on its behalf — but only if that vertical holds the staff-granted `emailSender`
  capability. The `from` address is always the platform's onboarded sender.

  The capability mirrors `tenantProvisioner` exactly, as three parts:

  - a manifest **request** — `package.json` `substrat.sendsEmail`, carried on push into the
    registry as `sendsEmail`, refreshed on every push and granting nothing by itself;
  - a registry **grant** — `emailSender`, a directory flag a push can never set or keep, flipped
    by the new staff op `setVerticalEmailSender` (and the console's "Grant email sender" toggle);
  - a platform-held **relay** — `PlatformRelayEmailTransport` (another `EmailTransport`
    implementation) on the vertical side, and the control-plane endpoint on the other, which
    re-derives _which_ vertical is calling from the named `(tenant, scope)` and checks the grant
    against that. Holding the shared `PLATFORM_SECRET` (injected into every dispatch script, and
    the relay's auth) is not enough. The control plane's own origin is injected into every vertical
    as `CONTROL_PLANE_URL` so it knows where to POST.

  `HostAdmin` gains `setVerticalEmailSender`; both adapters persist a nullable `email_sender`
  directory column (a directory schema change, not a module migration). The auth-server demo
  declares `sendsEmail` and uses the relay transport when hosted, so its Better-Auth
  `sendResetPassword` flow finally delivers on a dispatch install. Everything is additive — every
  existing manifest, registry row, and `HostAdmin` call site keeps compiling.

### Patch Changes

- 3246681: Guard `reapScope` so a still-serving scope can never be reaped. A serving app
  always holds ≥1 bound hostname, so `reapScope` now refuses (fail closed) while
  any hostname is bound to the scope — unbind first, a visible and reversible step.

  The hole this closes: `reapScope` _assumed_ "hostnames were released at archive",
  which is true for the dashboard delete path (it unbinds) but not for a bare
  console `archiveScope` (a status flip only). An archived-but-still-bound scope
  walked straight into the irreversible wipe, taking a live app's storage with it.

  The guard is enforced in two places — the host adapter (so the contract suite
  asserts it for every adapter) and the per-scope reap route, ahead of the
  vertical's `deleteScope` where the production wipe actually happens. `HostAdmin.reapScope`
  gains an optional `{ force?: boolean }`: deliberate teardown (tenant reap §4.8,
  retention sweeps §4.4) releases every name by design and sets `force: true`; the
  interactive per-scope reap never does.

### Minor Changes

- d222905: Platform blob store + attachment surface (#473): `attachmentTargets`, declared by
  the contract and every engine but implemented by nothing, now has a runtime home.

  - **A fourth store shape.** `blobStoreNeed` in `runtimeNeeds.blobStores` — the
    `tenantStoreNeed` sibling for attachment bytes: the platform mints one bucket per
    tenant (R2 on `adapter-cloudflare`, a per-tenant directory on the pure adapter), the
    builder declares no id, so it is a _need_ the platform provisions, never an `r2_bucket`
    binding the bundle carries. Seams: `ScopeHost.provisionBlobStore` / `listBlobStores`,
    a `blob_stores` ledger in both adapters, and the `createR2BlobStores` REST client.
  - **`attachmentTargets` consumed.** `ScopeHost.attachments(principal, tenant, scope)`
    gates every read by the declared target's `readPermission` and every mutation by its
    new optional `writePermission` (default: the read key) — proof path included,
    per-entity, evaluated where `ctx.check` is. The read gate no longer leaves `ctx` for a
    hand-rolled route handler.
  - **Rows in the scope, bytes in the store.** The metadata fact lands in a new
    `_substrat_attachments` table inside the scope database (so `scope pull` / restore /
    PITR carry it), transactional with an `attachment.added` / `attachment.removed` spine
    event. Bytes go straight to the per-tenant store, never through the scope's
    structured-clone invoke pipe. Keys are platform-derived (`scope/<scopeId>/att/<id>`),
    so per-scope isolation inside a per-tenant store is construction, not convention.
  - **Integrity across the split.** Bytes are SHA-256'd at upload and written once under a
    fresh ULID key, so a row can never point at bytes other than the ones it was born with;
    a PITR rewind can at worst orphan an object (GC-able), never re-point a row.
  - **Deploy path.** The WfP bindings patcher and every in-place serving upload now
    re-derive `r2_bucket` bindings from the blob-store ledger alongside the D1 tenant-store
    bindings (`blobStoreBindingName(binding, tenantId)`), so a re-deploy is structurally
    unable to drop a tenant's attachment bucket. The CLI carries `blobStores` from
    `runtimeNeeds` into the deploy manifest, admitted as a need (never a binding).

### Patch Changes

- e9c7bd0: `deleteVertical`'s bound-scope refusal no longer counts `reaped` tombstones —
  they are terminal history, and counting them made any vertical that ever had an
  install permanently undeletable. An `archived` scope (a deleted app) still
  blocks, since unarchive can restore it, but the refusal now names the actual
  remaining step ("reap or restore them first") instead of telling the caller to
  delete an app that is already gone. Contract-tested in both adapters.

## 0.40.0

### Minor Changes

- d96269e: Adapters report committed platform intents to the stub minter (#458). `getScope` accepts `ScopeStubOptions` with an `onPlatformRequests(count)` observer, fired after an invoke commits having enqueued `ctx.requestPlatform` intents — never on rollback. A vertical wires it once in its stub helper to flag responses `x-substrat-platform-request` (new kernel constant `PLATFORM_REQUEST_HEADER`), so the router kick (#381) drains provisioning in seconds without per-route hand-wiring.
- 3c77f64: Connections become multi-account per provider — the Vercel "Git namespace" shape. Live-uniqueness widens from (tenant, vertical, provider) to (tenant, vertical, provider, account), where the account leg is `COALESCE(external_account_ref, '')`, so providers that never set an account ref keep their singleton semantics while a tenant can now hold one GitHub connection per org/user. `openConnection` gains an optional `externalAccountRef` selector (omitted with several accounts live it throws rather than picking one arbitrarily), `connectionFilter` gains `externalAccountRef`, and both adapters migrate the old `_substrat_connections_live` index in place (`DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` + the new `_substrat_connections_live_account`). The dashboard's git-import flow connects additional GitHub accounts without severing the first, lists repos per selected namespace, and threads the account through branches + one-click CI setup.
- d59a515: Every list read pages the same way: the admin-log cursor convention, generalized.
  `@substrat-run/contracts` gains `pagination.ts` (`listPageQuery` — limit default 20,
  max 200 — `ListPage`, `Page<T>`, `pageOf`); every `HostAdmin.list*` takes an optional
  keyset page (unset stays unbounded for in-process callers); both adapters implement
  the keyset SQL and the contract suite proves it. **Wire change:** every control-plane
  GET list route (`/tenants`, `/scopes`, `/verticals`, `/verticals/:slug/versions`,
  `/channels`, `/channels/:channel/history`, `/hostnames`, `/roles`, `/admin-log`) now
  returns `{ entries, nextCursor }` and defaults a 20-row page — older CLI versions
  parse these as bare arrays and must upgrade; this CLI walks the cursor wherever it
  needs the complete list.

### Patch Changes

- 3a0eaa4: Declared schedules run on a CP-less host (#461). `provisionScopeLocal` now projects each registered module's `system:<moduleId>` schedule grants (#383) into the scope's tuples, in the same atomic projection unit as the owner grant — without them the grant-is-the-switch check reported `fired: 0` forever, indistinguishable from "nothing due". And `runDueSchedules` skips the control-plane liveness read on a CP-less host, which has no directory to ask and already trusts the router-asserted (tenant, scope). `scheduleMod` is now exported from contract-tests for adapter-level CP-less coverage.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cf4e3b: The provisioner capability gains its request half (#455): a manager vertical DECLARES the
  target verticals it provisions — package.json `substrat.provisions`, carried on push to
  the registry row (`vertical.provisions`, riding the refreshable install*spec bag) — and
  the console reviews the declaration like a publish request (declared-but-ungranted shows
  as \_provisioner requested*; the grant button reads _Approve provisioner_). Declaration is
  a request, never a grant: `tenantProvisioner` stays the staff-flipped flag a push cannot
  touch (contract-tested both ways). The drain's `admitManager` now distinguishes
  _undeclared_ (fix your manifest) from _declared-but-ungranted_ (awaiting staff) in its
  refusal, and — #412 invariant 4 — bounds a granted manager's `provision-tenant` to its
  declared targets, phased: a granted manager that declares nothing keeps its pre-#455
  unbounded behavior until its next push declares.

### Minor Changes

- 5afb162: The tenant-provisioner capability becomes a directory-backed staff grant (#444, #412).
  `vertical.tenantProvisioner` is a registry flag flipped by the new audited
  `setVerticalTenantProvisioner` admin action (console: Grant/Revoke provisioner, route
  `POST /verticals/:slug/tenant-provisioner`, staff-only) and read by the drain's
  `admitManager` at execution time — replacing the `TENANT_PROVISIONERS` env list, which
  was configured nowhere and would have put customer slugs in deployment config. Never set
  at registration and never touched by a re-push refresh (contract-tested): pushing code is
  never how a vertical acquires or keeps platform authority. BREAKING for
  `control-plane-api` consumers: `ManagedTenantDeps.provisioners` is gone — the grant
  lives on the registry row.

### Minor Changes

- 070f4dc: A vertical can schedule its own recurring work (#383)

  A vertical can now declare `schedules` in its module manifest — operations the platform
  invokes on every live scope of it, on a cadence, driven by the existing platform sweep. It
  is the seam a domain rule triggered by the passage of time (a contract that activates on its
  start date, a leave that can no longer be approved once it has already begun) had no way to
  reach: the operation was written, idempotent, and paged, but nothing woke it up on a date.

  The work is attributed honestly. Rather than the out-of-band workaround of signing in as a
  human and running under their permission — the attribution laundering #97 refused — a
  schedule runs under a **system principal**, the third caller #97 named, built the same way it
  built the connector seam:

  - a new `{ kind: 'system', id: ModuleId }` check-subject, mirror of the connection subject;
  - `ScopeHost.getSystemScope(moduleId, tenantId, scopeId)` — a door whose stub stamps
    `{ system: moduleId }` on events and resolves `system:<moduleId>` grants;
  - `HostAdmin.grantToSystem(...)` — the scheduler analogue of `grantToConnection`, projected
    from a schedule's declared `permissions` at provisioning, so `ctx.check` stays the single
    gate and the grant appears in the reviewed permission diff. Revoking it disables the
    schedule for one tenant, no special flag.

  `runPlatformSweep` gains a schedules phase (`registeredSchedules` / `runDueSchedules`) that
  enumerates each vertical's live scopes and fires due operations under bounded concurrency,
  skipping forks and any scope that does not hold the grant, recording per-scope outcomes in
  `PlatformSweepReport.schedules`. All additive: a manifest that declares no schedules, and a
  host predating the seam, behave exactly as before.

### Patch Changes

- 50d9260: Platform intents, Phase B1: the drain surface (read + settle).

  Adds the read/settle half of the platform-intent queue from `docs/architecture/platform-intents.md`, so
  the platform can pull a scope's pending intents and journal their outcome. `ScopeHost` gains
  `listPlatformRequests(tenantId, scopeId)` (pending intents, mapped to the `PlatformRequest`
  contract shape) and `settlePlatformRequest(tenantId, scopeId, id, { status, result, lastError })`
  (mark `done` / `failed` / `pending`-for-retry). Both are fleet-maintenance (no actor), the same
  class as `drainDue`, implemented symmetrically in both adapters (a `pendingPlatformRequests` /
  `settlePlatformRequest` DO RPC pair on the Cloudflare scope DO; direct table reads/writes on the
  SQLite adapter).

  `result` is COALESCE'd on settle, so a value written on an earlier pass (e.g. a minted sibling
  scope id for two-phase idempotency) survives an omitted one on retry. Contract-suite coverage on
  both adapters: list-pending → settle-done → drops from pending with its result recorded, and a
  transient `pending` retry preserves the two-phase result.

  No cross-deployment execution yet — the `VerticalClient` `/internal/platform-requests` transport,
  the kind→handler drain engine, `provision-sibling`, and the sweep wiring are Phase B2 (#358). The
  key constraint driving that split: the control plane can't read a vertical's scope DO directly
  (different deployments — the reason the CP sweep runs `drainRetries: false`), so B2 drains over the
  vertical's `/internal/*` HTTP surface, exactly like Data-tab introspection.

### Patch Changes

- 67be7c7: Platform intents, Phase A: the `ctx.requestPlatform` primitive.

  Adds the foundation from `docs/architecture/platform-intents.md` — the sandbox-clean way a vertical
  asks the platform for a privileged action (provision a sibling scope, quota, …) without an
  upward call. A vertical operation calls `ctx.requestPlatform({ kind, payload })` after its own
  permission check; the kernel durably records a typed intent in this scope's new
  `_substrat_platform_requests` spine table (atomic with the operation, stamped with the actor), and
  returns the request id. The platform will pull and execute these with `HostAdmin` authority in a
  later phase — knowing the tenant inherently because it reads that scope's own DO.

  - `OperationContext` gains `requestPlatform(input): PlatformRequestId` (kernel), implemented
    symmetrically in both adapters; `contracts` gains `platformRequestId`, `platformRequestInput` /
    `platformRequest` schemas, and the `MAX_PENDING_PLATFORM_REQUESTS` backpressure bound (the verb
    refuses once a scope holds that many pending intents).
  - **Migration checkpoint:** a new `_substrat_platform_requests` spine table is added to each
    adapter's `KERNEL_DDL` (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it back-fills existing scopes on next
    open). No versioned module migration; it is kernel spine, flagged `system` automatically.
  - Contract-suite coverage (both adapters): the intent is enqueued as `pending` with its kind /
    payload / actor, and rolls back with its operation when the handler throws (K-4).

  No consumer yet — the drain-executor, router kick, and the Manyfold "New site" flow are later
  phases (#358).

### Minor Changes

- e612b98: Reap archived scopes (§4.4): free the Durable Object storage that Cloudflare never
  garbage-collects. Deleting an app archives its scope — a tombstone-only transition that
  keeps the directory row but leaves the scope DO holding every byte forever. This adds a
  terminal `reaped` state past `archived`: `reapScope` wipes the DO's storage while keeping
  the directory row (audit history + burned slug), the one irreversible scope transition, so
  it only ever leaves `archived`, `getScope` fails closed on it, and its slug is released for
  reuse. Delivered two ways over one seam — the storage wipe reaches the vertical's own
  deployment (a hosted scope's DO is CP-less) via the same `deleteScope` dispatch the snapshot
  GC uses: a staff-only `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/reap` (armed in the console behind a
  type-the-slug dialog, since there is no restore), and a `runPlatformSweep` phase that reaps
  scopes archived longer than `SCOPE_RETENTION_DAYS` — opt-in and unset by default, because
  the reap cannot be undone. Both adapters gain an additive `archived_at` column (stamped on
  archive, cleared on unarchive) to age the sweep, and their `(tenant_id, slug)` unique index
  becomes partial on the live statuses so a retained tombstone never blocks the slug reuse the
  pre-check already intends — closing a latent gap where archived slugs could not actually be
  reclaimed.
- caedb1c: A prod promote no longer strands a legacy scope's data, and the in-place serve is honest and
  complete end-to-end (#321). #287 shipped the serve-in-place, but existing (pre-#286) scopes were
  never migrated onto the stable serving script, so every promote re-stranded them: the private-
  vertical rebind cascade advanced a legacy scope's version to the incoming version's fresh,
  empty per-version dispatch script, `0001-init` re-ran against empty storage, and the app rendered
  a no-access page that read as an auth bug rather than data loss.

  - **Adopt-before-rebind on promote.** For a dispatch-backed vertical, the host rebind cascade is
    skipped (an embedded vertical, with no per-version script, keeps it) and the control-plane-api
    prod-promote handler owns adopt-then-rebind in the correct order: after a successful in-place
    serve, each still-legacy owned scope is adopted onto the stable serving script — its bytes moved
    off the per-version script _before_ any version pointer advances — then rebound. Retry-safe:
    nothing rebinds until the adopt succeeds, so a failed serve strands nothing and a re-promote
    resumes. A shared `adoptScopeOntoServing` primitive backs both this and the explicit endpoint.

  - **A builder-triggerable backfill for existing installs.** `substrat scope adopt-serving <scopeId>`
    migrates one legacy scope; `--vertical <slug>` (and `POST /verticals/:slug/adopt-serving`)
    backfills every still-legacy scope of a vertical. Idempotent.

  - **`scope restore` accepts an adapter-sqlite scope file and errors actionably.** `importDump`/
    `loadDump` re-assert the kernel spine after the drop-then-replay, so a dump that omits
    `_substrat_roles`/`_substrat_tenant_tuples` (an adapter-sqlite scope file keeps them in its
    directory db) no longer leaves the target missing spine tables and crashing a later check with a
    bare `no such table` → the detail-less `internal error` the field report hit. The restore route
    returns an actionable 422 instead of the generic 500.

  - **A failed in-place serve stops reading as "deployed."** `servingVersionId` is added to the
    channel surface (`VerticalChannel` + both adapters' `listChannels`): a prod promote moves the
    channel pointer before the serve, so when the serve fails `servingVersionId !== versionId` is the
    honest signal that the scopes still run the previous code. `substrat versions`, the dashboard
    deployments view, and the console surface the divergence and prompt a re-promote.

  - **An empty role projection is a platform condition, not only a per-app 403.** A new
    `GET /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/health` reports `roleProjectionEmpty` for an active scope whose served
    DO has zero projected roles (the silent state the field report chased through a migration-journal
    diff); the console Scopes detail raises it as a flagged condition.

  Prevents future stranding and gives a migration path for existing installs. Recovering data already
  stranded by an earlier bad promote (locating the specific prior per-version script) is a separate
  ops task, out of scope here.

- f0df69a: Tenant delete with a grace window (§4.8, #36): reclaim a deleted tenant's data instead of
  stranding it forever. `deleting` was a dead status — written once (a dashboard team-delete)
  and never consumed, so a tenant marked for deletion kept every byte. This finishes the
  lifecycle as the tenant analogue of §4.4's scope reap.

  `tenantStatus` gains a terminal `reaped` past `deleting`, and the `tenants` row gains a
  `deletingAt` timestamp (stamped on entering `deleting`, cleared on un-delete) so the grace
  window can be aged. `deleting` stays a reversible pause — every scope already fails `getScope`
  closed under a non-active tenant, so nothing is destroyed until a reap, and an un-delete (→
  `active`) restores the tenant whole. `reapTenant` (new on `HostAdmin`, directory-side only)
  clears the tenant's PII/config directory rows — identities and identity pools, membership
  tuples, roles, entitlements, orgs — and flips the row to a `reaped` tombstone, keeping the
  `tenants` row (burned slug + history) and `_substrat_admin_log` whole. It refuses any tenant
  not in `deleting`; `reaped` is unreachable via `setTenantStatus`.

  Delivered over one seam, two ways: a staff-only `POST /tenants/:t/reap` ("reap now", armed in
  the console behind a type-the-slug dialog, refused with 409 unless the tenant is `deleting`),
  and a `runPlatformSweep` phase that reaps tenants whose `deletingAt` is older than
  `TENANT_RETENTION_DAYS` — opt-in and unset by default, because the reap is irreversible. The
  per-scope byte-wipe runs above the kernel: the reaper archives-if-needed then reaps each scope
  through the existing `reapScopeFn` seam (so the control plane's orchestrated per-scope wipe
  applies for free), then clears the directory via `reapTenant`.

  Also settles #36's retention question: the admin log is the compliance witness (bokföringslagen
  §5.3) and is deliberately **never swept** — no TTL. The bound against dumping an ever-growing
  table lives on the read surface instead: `GET /admin-log` now defaults a page size (the
  in-process `auditLog` stays unbounded, so an internal caller that wants everything still gets it,
  and `nextCursor` walks the whole log).

  Full-tenant export (GDPR Art. 20 portability) is intentionally out of scope here — the per-scope
  `exportScope` seam it builds on already exists.

### Minor Changes

- 72b1128: Entitlements express a plan (#33): the two-column SKU flag grows `expiresAt`,
  `quota`, `plan` and `grantedAt`/`grantedBy`. Expiry is the one field the kernel
  itself enforces — an expired grant fails closed at the per-invoke gate exactly as
  if revoked, checked lazily at read like tuple expiry (never swept), and the row
  stays in `listEntitlements` so a lapsed trial reads as lapsed rather than
  never-granted. Quota and tier are expression only, per the D-33 reframe: they
  describe the builder's subscription, and counting usage against them is the
  builder portal's job — which is why plan _expression_ lands ahead of billing
  (#39 stays blocked on meters). Grant calls are PATCH-shaped: omitted fields
  preserve what the row carries (a bare re-grant on an idempotent provisioning
  path cannot silently turn a trial perpetual), explicit null clears, and any
  effective change is a renewal audited with before/after. `listEntitlements` now
  returns `EntitlementGrant[]` instead of `string[]`; the PUT route accepts the
  plan as an optional body (a bodyless PUT stays the bare-flag grant); both
  adapters widen `_substrat_entitlements` with nullable columns via the existing
  ensure-column path, so legacy rows read as perpetual boolean flags — exactly
  their old semantics. The console shows and edits the plan half; Callout's boot
  mirror forwards whole grants so the shared plane never sees a trial as
  perpetual.
- 1cfce31: A hosted vertical reads its entitlements at request time from a scope-local projection (#304),
  settling kernel open-question 5 with the same answer as the routing cache.

  Entitlements used to be a coordinator-only, trust-at-provision check: it gated _module loading_,
  but a dispatched worker could not read `plan`/`quota`/`tier` at request time — the `CONTROL_PLANE`
  binding is forbidden by the sandbox contract (#302) — and a CP-less scope short-circuited the gate
  to `true`, enforcing nothing in-request, not even expiry.

  Entitlements are now **projected into each scope** alongside roles and tenant tuples, extending the
  scope-local-permissions machinery rather than duplicating it:

  - **`OperationContext` gains `entitlement(key)` and `entitlements()`** — the sanctioned request-time
    read. Returns the live view (`key`, `plan`, `quota`, `expiresAt`) or `null`; expiry is applied at
    read, so a non-null result is always live. A hosted scope reads its local projection; a
    console-managed scope reads over the same RPC the permission checker uses. New `EntitlementView`
    contract type.
  - **The per-operation gate fails closed against the projection** on the scope-local path — expiry
    and revocation now enforce at request time in a hosted vertical, not only at provision.
  - **A grant/revoke fans out to invalidate** the projected scopes — the event-invalidation half of
    kernel open-question 5's answer (cached in scope DOs with event invalidation), deliberately the
    same project-on-write mechanism the routing/suspension cache defers to.

  Two posture calls, per #33's grain:

  - **Expose, don't enforce** `quota`/`plan`: the kernel gates presence + expiry; the vertical reads
    the number and enforces its own quota (no kernel usage-counting).
  - **Fail-closed enforcement flips per scope** via an `entitlements_enforced` marker set the first
    time entitlements are projected — a scope provisioned before #304 keeps trusting upstream until a
    fan-out / reconcile / re-provision back-fills it, so the switch to strict enforcement strands no
    live scope.

  `provisionScopeLocal` accepts an optional `entitlements` list (the platform passes the tenant's
  grants at provision). Scoped out as a follow-up: the platform→dispatched-vertical provision path
  (control-plane-api) does not yet _pass_ entitlements into `provisionScopeLocal`, so re-projection to
  a live dispatched worker rides re-provision/reconcile until that is wired; expiry still enforces
  locally meanwhile, because the projected row carries it.

- aa503c2: Record what authorized a mutation on its event, and what was refused (K-34, K-35).

  **K-34 — authorization on the event envelope.** `ctx.check` computes a `Decision` whose
  allow branch carries the proof chain, and the kernel discarded it — so a mutation-event
  recorded who acted but never under what authority. `DomainEvent` gains an optional,
  kernel-stamped `authorization: {permission, grant?}[]`: the checks the emitting operation
  passed, plus — when the allow came via a capability grant rather than a role — the granting
  tuple's `object` (the entity/node it was granted on). The shape correction from the design
  note: there is no grant _id_ — a grant is a relation tuple with no surrogate key, so the
  tuple's object is what names it; `contracts` exports `grantRefFromProof` for this. The full
  proof chain is not persisted (`explain` re-derives it); only the pointer re-derivation
  cannot recover — which check was consulted at write time — is kept. Module code can neither
  supply it (not on `DomainEventInput`) nor suppress it; system/override actors are
  unconditionally allowed, so their checks are not recorded. The operation context is now
  built fresh per invoke so the accumulator cannot leak across operations.

  **K-35 — a scope-local denial log.** `assertAllowed` threw `PermissionDenied` and nothing
  recorded it. A denial happens in the scope's serialization domain and rolls its own
  operation back, so it cannot reach the directory access log and would be erased if written
  in the operation's transaction. It now lands in a scope-local `_substrat_denials` (actor,
  permission, node, operation, at, drained_at), recorded at the operation boundary the moment
  a `PermissionDenied` unwinds it — a fresh autocommit write after the rollback, so it
  survives. Only enforced denials record; a bare `ctx.check` a module branches on is not a
  denial. `PermissionDenied` now carries the checked `permission` and `node`.

  Both surfaces are additive kernel-schema changes (a nullable `_substrat_outbox.authorization`
  column and the new `_substrat_denials` table), applied on both adapters (pure-SQLite and the
  DO port) via KERNEL_DDL + an additive column on existing scopes. Legacy outbox rows read as
  `authorization` NULL — honestly unrecorded, not empty. Held to the same contract on both
  adapters by new cases in the permission contract suite.

  `restoreScopeLocal` on the Cloudflare host, `/internal/restore` on the vertical
  surface (VerticalClient + the Manyfold reference worker), a staff-only
  `POST /tenants/:tenantId/scopes/:scopeId/restore` control-plane route that delegates
  to the bound version's deployment, and `substrat scope restore <scopeId> --file
<backup>` — accepting a `scope pull` .sqlite, a local adapter-sqlite scope file, or

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- b23c0a7: The Data tab grows a SQL console (#219): `HostAdmin.queryScope` runs ONE read-only SQL
  statement against a scope's own database, next to the table-shaped reads that stay safe
  by construction. User SQL reaching the DB moves the safety to statement-level
  enforcement, in two layers shared across adapters:

  - the kernel's `assertReadOnlyQuery` — a comment/string/identifier-aware token scan
    that rejects multi-statement input, a first keyword outside SELECT/WITH/VALUES/
    EXPLAIN, and any bare write/DDL/session verb anywhere (`WITH … INSERT INTO` is valid
    SQLite, so the first keyword alone proves nothing); deliberately over-strict, since a
    false positive costs a quoted identifier and a false negative forges the spine;
  - an adapter-authoritative backstop: better-sqlite3's `prepare().readonly`
    (sqlite3_stmt_readonly) on the pure adapter, and a transaction that ALWAYS rolls
    back inside the ScopeDO, whose `exec` has no read-only flag.

  Results are positional rows capped at `SCOPE_QUERY_ROW_MAX` (200) with a `truncated`
  flag — a ceiling, never an error. Same K-3 (tenantId, scopeId) cross-check and K-24
  access log as the table reads; the logged argument is the SQL itself. The refusal
  message prefix (`read-only console:`) is contract — pinned by the shared suite against
  both adapters and mapped to 400 by the transport.

  Transport: `POST /tenants/:tenantId/scopes/:scopeId/query` with the same
  vertical-delegation as the table reads (`VerticalClient.queryScope` →
  `/internal/query`); a vertical that cannot answer safely refuses with its own status,
  relayed verbatim — auth-server keeps refusing via its `/internal/*` 501 catch-all,
  because its DO redacts secret-bearing columns on table reads and arbitrary SQL would
  walk around the redaction. Editing rows stays out of scope forever: a write here would
  bypass the event log and forge the spine.

### Minor Changes

- ec89a88: Vertical lifecycle: delete a vertical, and block new installs of one.

  **`deleteVertical`** (HostAdmin + `DELETE /verticals/:slug`, staff-only): removes the
  registry row, its versions, and its channels — **refused while any scope is still
  bound** to the vertical, naming the count, so a delete can never strand a live scope's
  version pin or routing. Deployed dispatch scripts are left as orphans for the cleanup
  script (#248), never reaped inline. Audited. The console's vertical detail card gets a
  type-the-slug-to-confirm Delete.

  **`installsBlocked`** (new registry flag + `setVerticalInstallsBlocked` /
  `POST /verticals/:slug/install-block`, staff-only): the install kill-switch, orthogonal
  to `listed`. A blocked vertical is hidden from the dashboard's install catalog and the
  control plane refuses to provision an instance of it (403) — for everyone, owner
  included. Existing scopes keep serving: it gates provisioning, not serving. Additive
  `installs_blocked` column in both adapters (attempt-and-tolerate migration, default 0).
  Console gets a Block/Allow installs toggle and a "blocked" badge.

  The console also now shows **timestamps**: when each version was pushed (table +
  promote picker), when each channel pointer last moved, and when a vertical was
  registered.

### Patch Changes

- cd32011: Marketplace apps/verticals split + the empty-marketplace fix.

  **Adapters:** `registerVertical` now refreshes `listed` on an identical re-registration
  of a **builtin** vertical (it is seed metadata, derived from the catalog's `connected`
  flag). Rows registered before the `listed` column existed (migration default 0) were
  stuck unlisted forever, so the hosted marketplace rendered empty. A pushed (`cli`/`git`)
  vertical's `listed` stays untouched — re-pushing a published vertical still cannot
  silently unpublish it.

  **Dashboard:** the create-app page is now pure instantiation, grouped **Marketplace**
  (published) and **Your verticals** (your team's own, badged Private/Published, disabled
  until a version is promoted to prod). The Deployments page is renamed **Verticals**
  (`#/deployments` stays as an alias) and takes over the supply side: the GitHub
  import + one-click CI scaffold move there from create-app. `GET /api/catalog` returns
  `{owned, listed, source, installable}` and, in connected mode, merges the shared
  control plane's registry — so a pushed vertical shows up and (via the same fallback in
  `installSpecFor`) installs in production, not just embedded mode.

### Minor Changes

- 74c9d7b: Add `unassignRole` and `unlinkIdentity` to the `HostAdmin` surface — the inverses of `assignRole` and `linkIdentity`, so authority granted through the kernel can also be taken back.

  - `unassignRole(actor, assignment)` revokes a role assignment by tombstoning the role tuple (K-21): the checker stops resolving it, the tuple stays as audit evidence, and a later `assignRole` of the same `(principal, role, node)` reactivates it. Idempotent.
  - `unlinkIdentity(actor, tenantId, principal)` severs a principal's login from a tenant — keyed by principal (so the caller needs no external subject) and a DELETE rather than a tombstone, so `listIdentityTenants`/`resolveIdentity` stop returning it and a re-invite can re-link a fresh principal.

  Both are implemented in the SQLite and Cloudflare adapters (with a generic tenant/scope tuple revoke on the Cloudflare DOs) and add matching `adminAction` log entries. Together they unblock self-serve member removal: cut a member's access and drop the team from their surface.

## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- 0572a3b: **Typecheck on the native (Go) TypeScript compiler — `typescript` 5.6 → 7.**

  TypeScript 7 (the native compiler, formerly the `tsgo`/`@typescript/native-preview`
  rewrite) is now GA as `typescript@latest`. The binary is still `tsc`, so every package's
  `tsc -p … --noEmit` script is unchanged — only the toolchain pin moves. No source or
  public API changes; this bumps the published packages solely because their build now runs
  through the native compiler.

  Full-workspace `pnpm -r typecheck` drops to ~3s wall; per-package the native checker is
  roughly an order of magnitude faster (kernel 1.33s → 0.07s, control-plane-api 1.50s →
  0.12s, engine-invoicing 0.91s → 0.06s on this machine).

  Two migration deltas TS7's stricter resolution surfaced (both green on 5.6, red on 7):

  - **CSS side-effect imports (`TS2882`).** `import './ui.css'` in the six Vite app/admin
    surfaces now needs an ambient declaration. Fixed the way `demos/meridian/app` already
    did it — `"types": ["vite/client"]` in each app `tsconfig.json` (vite/client declares
    `*.css`) — rather than adding a stray `vite-env.d.ts`.
  - **`boundary-lint` node globals (`TS2584`/`TS2591`).** The linter CLI's `process`,
    `console`, and `node:fs`/`node:path` imports stopped resolving because the base tsconfig
    leaves `types` unset and TS7 no longer implicitly pulls in `@types/node` here. Added an
    explicit `"types": ["node"]` to `packages/boundary-lint/tsconfig.json`.

  Note: TS7 is a major bump that drops deprecated 5.x behavior. Editors should run their
  TS Server on 7 to keep CLI and IDE diagnostics aligned.

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- a277bb7: **Fix: a migration whose comment or string literal contains a semicolon no longer fails only on
  Durable Objects.**

  The two scope-host adapters applied module migrations differently, and that divergence was a
  latent trap:

  - the **SQLite** adapter hands the whole migration blob to better-sqlite3's `exec`, which parses
    comments, string literals, and multiple statements correctly;
  - the **Cloudflare** adapter ran `migration.sql.split(';')` and `exec`'d each fragment — a naive
    split that truncates a statement the moment a `;` appears inside a `--` / `/* */` comment or a
    string literal. SQLite then reports `incomplete input`.

  So a migration could be **green on every node test and CI run, then fail only on `workerd`** in
  production. (Found porting Meridian to Cloudflare: an `hr_absence_ledger` column comment read
  `-- signed decimal days; balance = SUM(delta)` and broke `CREATE TABLE`.)

  The fix replaces the naive split with `splitSqlStatements` — a small SQL-aware scanner that skips
  line and block comments, copies string literals through verbatim (including the `''` escape), and
  splits only on a top-level `;`. Comments are dropped from emitted statements, so a trailing
  comment can never become a comment-only fragment that `exec` rejects either.

  To make the class of bug unmissable and keep the adapters from diverging again, the shared
  contract-test module `testMod`'s migration now deliberately contains all the hard cases — a `;` in
  a line comment, in a block comment, and in a string-literal `DEFAULT`, plus a second statement.
  Every suite that provisions a scope therefore exercises it on **both** adapters; a naive splitter
  fails provisioning outright. `splitSqlStatements` also has direct unit coverage of each edge case.

- 7e17b16: **Connector state, and idempotent dispatch — the Scrive connector no longer duplicates
  documents on retry.**

  The connector took an injected `onDispatched` callback because it had nowhere to record what
  it had done. Delivery is at-least-once, so a redelivery created a _second_ Scrive document —
  duplicate legal paperwork to real signatories.

  The obvious fix — write the dispatch record into the scope — **deadlocks**, confirmed with a
  spike: a connector runs inside the scope's post-commit dispatch, and re-entering the scope
  actor from there waits on the task that is waiting for it. So the ledger lives in the
  **directory**, which a connector reaches through `ctx.admin` without touching the scope:

  ```ts
  HostAdmin.putConnectorState(connectionId, key, value);
  HostAdmin.getConnectorState(connectionId, key);
  ```

  Arbitrary JSON, keyed by `(connection, key)`, in a new `_substrat_connector_state` directory
  table on both adapters. Not audited — high-frequency machine state, one write per dispatch, the
  same class as `recordConnectionUse`. It dies with the connection: revoke cascades.

  The connector now checks the ledger before creating a document and skips if a prior dispatch is
  recorded, then records the dispatch after `start`. `onDispatched` is gone. A narrow residual
  window remains (ledger write fails after `start` succeeds → the retry still duplicates),
  closable with provider-side dedup via the `substrat_instance` tag the connector now sets.

  `getConnectorScope` (from #108) is deliberately unused here: recording a _signature_ back into
  the scope is the poll driver's job, where it runs as a top-level operation and re-entry is
  safe. Dispatch idempotency is not a scope write and must not be one.

  Contract tests on both adapters cover the state round-trip, upsert, and revoke-cascade; the
  connector's own suite proves a recorded dispatch is skipped rather than repeated.

- e4db6ed: **`HostAdmin.listConnectorState` — the read a poll driver needs to find its own outstanding work.**

  `getConnectorState(id, key)` answers "did I already do THIS one" from a deterministic key — the
  dispatch-idempotency path. It cannot answer "what is still outstanding", because a poller does
  not know the keys up front:

  ```ts
  listConnectorState(id: ConnectionId, prefix?: string): Promise<{ key: string; value: unknown }[]>
  ```

  Returns every state row for a connection, optionally narrowed to keys under `prefix`, ordered by
  key. A connector records one row per dispatch under `<provider>:dispatch:<id>`, and a scheduled
  sweep enumerates them (`prefix = '<provider>:dispatch:'`) to reconcile each against the provider.
  Without this a sweep would have to be handed every id it might reconcile, which defeats the point
  of a sweep.

  A directory-local machine read, the same class as `getConnectorState` — not audited. Implemented
  on both adapters (sqlite in-process; Cloudflare on the control-plane DO, prefix filtered
  coordinator-side to avoid LIKE/GLOB escaping); the contract-test suite covers prefix narrowing,
  ordering, the empty-match case, and per-connection isolation, so both adapters are held to the
  same behaviour.

  This is the enumeration half of the Scrive connector's poll path (#96): `drainDue` and the new
  `sweepScriveReconciliations` both still need a _timer_ to call them, which remains a deployment
  concern (no cron/alarm exists yet).

### Minor Changes

- 9c1f0bb: **The connection store, and the first encryption primitive in the codebase.**

  Per-tenant credentials for external providers had nowhere to live. `master-plan.md §6`
  committed to a connection store; `kernel-design.md §1` deferred "the integrations hub beyond
  its contract stub", and the stub was never written either — no `Connection` type, no
  credential storage, nothing.

  **Keyed on (tenant, vertical, provider)**, not tenant alone. A vertical is a blast-radius
  boundary (D-30) and verticals are built by different companies (D-33), so one vendor's host
  code must not reach a credential another vendor connected for the same tenant. It also
  matches how OAuth issues clients. Cross-vertical sharing, if a real case ever appears, is an
  explicit grant rather than the default.

  **`SecretBox` is a new adapter surface** — D-18 classifies the KMS as an adapter. Before this
  every `crypto.subtle` call in the repo was a one-way digest and every secret was a plaintext
  Worker binding: nothing per-tenant, nothing rotatable, nothing encrypted at rest.
  `webCryptoSecretBox` (AES-256-GCM, fresh IV per seal, key id for rotation) is the default;
  Cloudflare Secrets Store or an external KMS drop in behind the same interface. A host with no
  `SecretBox` **refuses to store a credential** rather than storing one in the clear.

  Two leaks designed out rather than remembered:

  - `_substrat_admin_log.before`/`after` take arbitrary JSON and the log is **append-only**, so
    a credential written there could never be removed. Connection mutations log metadata only.
  - `adminAction` is a closed enum that `auditLog` parses _every_ row through, so unrecognised
    actions fail the read of the whole log. Three members added.

  Revoking **destroys the sealed blob** and tombstones the row: a grant that once existed is
  evidence of why an access was allowed (K-21), but keeping the usable credential would make it
  a liability. Uniqueness is over live rows, so a revoked connection can be replaced.

  New on `HostAdmin`: `createConnection`, `listConnections`, `updateConnectionSecret`,
  `revokeConnection`, `openConnection`, `recordConnectionUse`. `openConnection` takes no actor
  and is not audited — the same exemption `resolveHostname` and `resolveIdentity` hold, for the
  same reason: an audit row per outbound HTTP call would drown the log that matters. Health
  (`lastOkAt`/`lastError`) is what an operator can act on instead.

  Ten new **contract** tests, so both adapters must agree — including that the credential
  appears in neither a metadata read nor the audit log, that another vertical cannot open it,
  and that revoking destroys it.

  **These methods take a `PlatformActorId`, which is a deliberate deferral, not an answer.**
  Connecting a provider is a tenant admin's act, and routing it through a platform actor is the
  defect D-31 named for `addMember`. Recorded in `docs/architecture/connections.md` §3.5; no console
  flow should be built on this signature until the question is settled with membership's.

- 113160a: **The inbound authority seam (#97): a connection is a subject.**

  A provider's callback has to write back into a scope, and it is not a person. `getScope`
  demands a `PrincipalId`, so a connector could dispatch a document and then be unable to record
  that it had — which under at-least-once delivery means a retry sends a **second** one.

  ```ts
  getConnectorScope(connectionId, scopeId): Promise<ScopeStub>;
  grantToConnection(actor, grant): Promise<void>;
  ```

  **The door inherits its narrowing.** A connection is keyed (tenant, vertical, provider), so
  `getConnectorScope` refuses another tenant's scope, another vertical's scope, and a revoked
  connection — none of it re-declared, just the key enforced where it could have been widened.

  **Authority is an ordinary permission grant**, not a second mechanism. Tuples already expire,
  tombstone on revoke (K-21), carry a proof, and appear in the permission diff. A parallel
  "allowed operations" list — the first design — would have been a second gate that only one of
  the two would show up in a review.

  **A connection is not a person, and the model now says so.** `PermissionChecker.check` takes a
  `CheckSubject` (`{ kind: 'principal' } | { kind: 'connection' }`) instead of a `PrincipalId`.
  Minting a principal per connection would have been cheaper and wrong: every audit view would
  show a `principal:` subject for something that is not one — the confusion `PlatformActorId`'s
  separate brand exists to prevent. So the tuple proof reads `connection:01J…`, the event actor
  is `{ connection }` beside the existing `{ system }`, and membership expansion is skipped for a
  connection rather than queried — it belongs to no org and holds no role, so a role carrying a
  permission cannot leak into it.

  **Breaking for custom checkers.** Any `PermissionChecker` implementation must take a
  `CheckSubject`; `asPrincipal(id)` is exported for the common case. Both built-in adapters and
  the contract suite are updated.

  Five new tests in the permission contract suite, against the real tuple checker on both
  adapters: opening the door confers nothing · a grant allows exactly what it names and proves it
  with a `connection:` tuple · no roles or memberships leak in · another tenant's or vertical's
  scope is unreachable · revoking the connection closes the door in the same act that destroys
  the credential.

- 3fb38da: **`registerConnector` — an executor that also gets a credential and sanctioned egress.**

  The existing `ExecutorHandler` receives only `HostAdmin`, which is right for the one executor
  that exists (a directory write) and insufficient for anything that talks to a provider: no
  per-tenant credential, and no way to make an HTTP call that the platform can police.

  ```ts
  registerConnector(id, eventType, handler, options?)

  interface ConnectorContext {
    admin; tenantId; scopeId; vertical;
    connection(provider): Promise<ConnectorConnection>;   // opened credential + bound fetch
  }
  ```

  **Tenant and vertical are ambient**, taken from the event's scope rather than passed in, so a
  connector cannot reach a credential another vertical connected even by accident.

  **`fetch` is bound to the connection, not to the context.** Health has to land on the right
  row by construction; an ambient `ctx.fetch` would make the runtime guess which connection a
  call belonged to, and it would guess wrong the first time a connector talked to two. The
  handler is _given_ its fetch rather than importing one — the same move `ctx.sql` makes for
  module code, and for the same reason: timeouts, egress policy and health become properties of
  the seam instead of conventions an author has to remember.

  Kept as a second registration rather than widening `ExecutorHandler`: a membership executor
  should not be handed the machinery to call the internet. Both ride the same hardened dispatch,
  journal and retry policy from #100.

  Hosts take an optional `fetch`, so a provider can be stood up in memory. That is the only way
  to exercise a connector end to end before vendor credentials exist, and it stays useful
  afterwards because a real provider will not return 503 on demand.

  Three new contract tests across both adapters: a connector receives its tenant's credential and
  records health on success; a provider error is recorded on the connection; and a tenant with
  the SKU but no connection fails the delivery visibly rather than silently doing nothing.

- 2becfd5: **Executor deliveries retry, back off, and dead-letter instead of escaping the operation.**

  `ExecutorHandler` is the only outbound seam in the system. That was fine while the only
  executor wrote to the local directory; it stops being fine the moment one makes an HTTP
  call, which is the most likely thing in the system to fail transiently.

  Three specific defects, all fixed:

  - **A throwing handler escaped `invoke()` after the transaction committed.** The caller
    was told their work failed when it had not. A delivery failure and an operation failure
    are different facts, and only the second belongs in the caller's result.
  - **A poison event wedged the queue permanently.** The scan is `ORDER BY o.id`, so the
    failing event was re-selected first on every drain and executor _N+1_ never ran while
    _N_ threw.
  - **Nothing retried on its own.** With no timer anywhere, a failed delivery was retried
    only if someone happened to invoke another operation on that same scope — and nothing
    reported that it hadn't.

  New surface:

  ```ts
  registerExecutor(id, eventType, handler, retry?: ExecutorRetryPolicy)
  drainDue(tenantId, scopeId): Promise<ExecutorDrainReport>
  executorDeadLetters(tenantId, scopeId): Promise<ExecutorDeadLetter[]>
  ```

  Retry policy is **per executor** rather than a host constant: the defaults suit a
  directory write, and a connector making an outbound call wants a longer tail.
  `_substrat_deliveries` gains `attempts` and `next_attempt_at`, added by `ALTER` on both
  adapters — the defaults read as "terminal", which is correct for every row already there.
  Consumer dispatch is untouched.

  Behavioural change worth noting: an operation can now report success while its external
  effect has not happened yet. That is the correct semantics for an outbox, and it is what
  the path was already doing silently — the difference is that failures are now recorded,
  retried, and readable instead of being thrown at whoever held the request.

  Prerequisite for the integrations hub ([`docs/architecture/connections.md`](../../docs/architecture/connections.md)).
  Scheduling `drainDue` from a cron trigger or Durable Object alarm is not included here.

### Patch Changes

- d881f75: **Correct the Scrive connector against the real API, and widen the connector fetch body.**

  The connector was written from Scrive's docs. Driving the full lifecycle against
  `api-testbed.scrive.com` exposed three things the docs left ambiguous and the docs-reading got
  wrong — exactly the "a mock encodes the author's reading of the docs" caveat cashing out:

  - **Auth is OAuth1 PLAINTEXT, not OAuth2 bearer.** The Scrive UI's "Client credentials" and
    "Token credentials" are two halves of one four-part signature, not two schemes. The
    connection secret shape becomes `{ clientId, clientSecret, tokenId, tokenSecret }`.
  - **`POST /documents/new` returns no top-level `status`** — only `get` does. The connector now
    parses mutation responses for their id and reads status from `get`, which is the right design
    regardless (don't trust a mutation's echo).
  - **`setfile` is `multipart/form-data`**, not a base64 body.

  The kernel change: `ConnectorRequestInit.body` accepts `Uint8Array` as well as `string`, because
  a real upload is binary and a string body corrupts the file. Web `fetch` accepts both, so the
  adapters pass it straight through.

  `ScriveMock` is updated to the real request encodings (OAuth1 header, form-encoded `update`,
  multipart `setfile`, exactly-one-author) so it fails a connector regression rather than passing
  a shape the real API rejects. A new opt-in `test/live.test.ts` drives the real lifecycle when
  testbed credentials are present and skips otherwise, so CI stays offline while a local run
  verifies against reality.

  Still incomplete: the write-back (needs `getConnectorScope`, now available on `HostAdmin`) and a
  poll driver. And `se_bankid`-to-sign is disabled on the testbed account, so the BankID
  round-trip is unverified.

### Minor Changes

- 27872cc: Scopes are provisioned as `provisioning` and activated on confirmation (K-31).

  `provisionScope` wrote the directory row as `active`, so the row claimed a usable
  scope before anything had built one — and only the vertical can build one, because the
  DO class bundles the modules and lives in the vertical's deployment. The `provisioning`
  state existed in the enum for exactly this and was unused.

  `HostAdmin.activateScope` moves `provisioning → active`, through the same transition
  graph the other lifecycle moves use, so it is audited and cannot revive a suspended
  scope. `getScope` refuses anything not active, so an unconfirmed row is inert rather
  than misleading.

  `ControlPlaneClient.activateScope` is the push-mode equivalent, and the control-plane
  API gains `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/activate`.

  Migrations are still attempted for a `provisioning` scope before it is refused, so the
  lazy retry and its attempt counter survive — they are the only self-healing there is
  until the reconciliation sweep exists. A scope held back by a failed migration now
  reports the migration error rather than a bare "not active".

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c54637b: The hostname map: `hostname → (tenant, scope, vertical, surface, region)`.

  A provisioned scope had no URL, so "validate it works in production" had nowhere to
  point. `contracts/routing.ts` adds `hostnameBinding` and `routeTarget`, and `HostAdmin`
  adds `bindHostname` / `setHostnameStatus` / `listHostnames` / `resolveHostname`.

  `surface` is the correction: one hostname per scope was already wrong, because a single
  scope fronts a storefront and a back office, or a player app and a manager console.

  `region` sits on the binding rather than in a router deployed per jurisdiction, because
  Cloudflare's Regional Services is configured per hostname — residency is one more
  column, not a second topology.

  Bindings have a lifecycle (`pending` → `verifying` → `active`, or `failed` with a note),
  since a custom domain is DNS validation and certificate issuance rather than a string
  somebody sets. Only `active` resolves. `resolveHostname` takes no actor and is not
  logged — the machine-path carve-out `resolveIdentity` already has — and does not
  re-check suspension, which `getScope` owns.

  Additive on every published surface: new schemas, new `HostAdmin` methods, new tables.
  Nothing existing changed shape.

### Minor Changes

- 6900431: The directory becomes readable, and gets an HTTP surface.

  **New package: `@substrat-run/control-plane-api`** (AGPL-3.0-only + commercial,
  like the kernel it sits on). One Hono router over `HostAdmin` — the audited
  control-plane transport. Web-standard only, so the same router mounts in a Worker
  holding the `controlPlane` binding or behind a Node server. It is not module code:
  it never receives a `ctx` and never runs in a scope's serialization domain.

  **`HostAdmin` gains a read side.** The write side was complete; nothing could
  enumerate what it had written.

  - `listScopes(filter?)` / `getScopeRecord(tenantId, scopeId)` — the scope
    inventory §3.2 always claimed the directory was. `getScopeRecord` cross-checks
    the pair and returns `undefined` for another tenant's scope, the same
    fail-closed rule `getScope` applies (K-3).
  - `listRoles(filter?)` — roles were writable and not enumerable since the
    permission model shipped. Returns `TenantRole` (a `RoleDefinition` plus its
    tenant).
  - `auditLog(filter?)` widens: filter by scope, actor, action or time; `limit`,
    `cursor` and `order`. The cursor is the entry's own ULID — order is
    chronological, so a page carries its own continuation. **The default order is
    unchanged** (oldest first), so existing callers do not shift.

  **The `scope` contract is now enforced rather than aspirational.** It described
  `slug`/`kind`/`name`/`parentScopeId` and was parsed by nothing while the table had
  none of those columns. Every read now parses through it, and `Scope` gains
  `vertical`.

  **`ProvisionScopeInput` extends additively** — `slug`, `kind`, `name`, `vertical`
  are optional with behaviour-preserving defaults, so existing callers are
  untouched. An unnamed scope's slug defaults to its lowercased id (a ULID
  lowercases into a valid slug, so it is valid and unique by construction).

  **`schemaVersion` and `vertical` stop being placeholders.** Both shipped as
  columns written by nothing — `schemaVersion` was always `'0'`, `vertical` always
  `null`. `schemaVersion` is now the applied-migration count; `vertical` is stamped
  onto audit targets for scope-lifecycle actions.

  **Directory schema change, applied in place by both adapters.** The `scopes` table
  gains `parent_scope_id`/`slug`/`kind`/`name`/`vertical`, plus a unique index on
  `(tenant_id, slug)` and one on `tenants(slug)`. The directory is not a module and
  has no `SqlMigration[]` journal, so each adapter upgrades on open: add the columns,
  backfill legacy rows to the same defaults `resolveScopeRecord` applies, then create
  the unique indexes **after** the backfill (a unique index over NULL slugs would
  permit the duplicates it exists to forbid). No action is required of callers; an
  existing directory opens and migrates itself.

  **Slug uniqueness is now enforced**, which it never was despite the contract saying
  "unique within tenant". `createTenant` and `provisionScope` fail closed on a
  collision rather than reporting a silent no-op — `INSERT OR IGNORE` would have
  swallowed a colliding-slug-different-id create and reported it as idempotent.

### Minor Changes

- 5dd4085: Zod 4, and `contracts` re-exports `z` — closing a live from-scratch trap

  **The trap.** The published packages depend on `zod ^3.25.0` while `pnpm add zod`
  — which getting-started told users to run — installs Zod 4. pnpm resolves both:
  Zod 3 nested for our packages, Zod 4 for the user. Two copies, both "correct".
  Zod schemas do not compose across majors, so the moment a user wrote the pattern
  CLAUDE.md mandates ("operation inputs go through Zod schemas at the boundary")
  composing a contracts schema into their own —

                                                                                                                                                                                                    z.object({ facility: entityRef, unitPrice: money })

  — it failed at RUNTIME with `Invalid element at key "facility": expected a Zod
schema`, an error pointing nowhere near the cause. Not an exotic pattern: it is
  what `engines/workorder` itself does (`unitPrice: money`, `facility: entityRef`),
  so anyone copying the reference hit it immediately. Found by building a vertical
  from scratch against the published packages — the flow the docs describe and
  nobody had walked.

  **Two fixes, because they solve different halves.**

  1. **Zod 4 everywhere.** Aligns with what the ecosystem installs by default, so a
     user who reaches for `zod` gets our major. No code changes were needed — the
     schema subset in use (`z.object`, `.regex`, `.brand`, `.min`, `.optional`,
     `z.infer`) is stable across the major, and the one `z.record` was already the
     2-arg form Zod 4 requires. Build, typecheck, and the full suite pass unchanged.
  2. **`contracts` re-exports `z`.** The durable half: importing `z` from
     `@substrat-run/contracts` means the consumer never installs zod at all, so the
     versions cannot diverge. Fix 1 makes the trap dormant; fix 2 keeps it dormant
     when Zod 5 ships.

  `zod` is dropped from the getting-started install line; docs and the `substrat`
  skill both import `z` from contracts.

  **Breaking for consumers on Zod 3** — deliberately taken now, while there are
  effectively none, rather than later when there are.

  **Still open:** making `zod` a `peerDependency`. Contracts' schemas are part of
  its public API — consumers are meant to compose them, so their copy must be ours
  — which is textbook peer. As a plain dependency it nests silently instead of
  failing at install. Left as a separate call.

### Patch Changes

- db77d8c: `HostAdmin` is now asynchronous

  Every `HostAdmin` method returns a `Promise` — writes (`createTenant`,
  `setTenantStatus`, the scope-lifecycle transitions, `defineRole`/`assignRole`/
  `grant`/`grantToOrg`/`addMember`, `grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement`,
  `linkIdentity`) and reads (`getTenant`, `listTenants`, `listEntitlements`,
  `auditLog`, `resolveIdentity`) alike. `registerModule`/`defineOperation` stay
  synchronous (code-time bookkeeping); `getScope`/`provisionScope` were already async.

  Why: the pure adapter's synchronous admin worked only because it is in-process.
  The Cloudflare adapter (D-14) proved a durable/remote control plane — a Durable
  Object — cannot be synchronous, so the second adapter forced the interface to
  evolve. This is the two-adapter discipline doing its job. Callers now `await`
  admin calls; adapter-sqlite's methods present their synchronous SQLite work as
  Promises. Behavior, error messages, and every contract assertion are unchanged.

- 4ba235e: Cloudflare Durable-Object adapter — milestone 1: contract suites green in workerd

  The second adapter (D-14) now runs the **shared** contract suites against **real
  Durable Objects** in workerd. One scope = one SQLite-backed `ScopeDO`; operations
  run inside `ctx.storage.transaction(async …)` (the DO analogue of the pure
  adapter's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT/ROLLBACK`), with per-scope serialization,
  lazy migrations-on-wake, guards, entity links, and the outbox→consumer dispatch
  loop. `scopeHostContractSuite` + `permissionContractSuite` pass unchanged (43
  pass, 1 skip); the pure-SQLite adapter stays green.

  - **contract-tests**: handlers extracted into an importable `modules.ts` so a DO
    can bundle them (a DO cannot execute closures created in another isolate);
    assertions unchanged. New `supportsRuntimeRegistration` capability flag — the
    one dynamic-late-registration test is skipped on adapters whose module set is
    code-time (CF), since a deployed DO bundle cannot gain code at runtime.
  - **kernel**: `ulid()` is now **monotonic** within a process (ULID spec's
    monotonic factory) — two ids minted in the same millisecond sort in creation
    order, making the audit log's and outbox's "ULID order is chronological"
    invariant actually hold. Fixes a latent same-millisecond ordering flake.

  Milestone-1 limitation, deliberately scoped: `HostAdmin` is a **synchronous**
  interface, which cannot be backed by an async Durable Object — so the coordinator
  holds the directory (tenants/scopes/entitlements/audit/identities/roles) in
  memory and forwards only the cross-DO subset (roles + tenant tuples) to a
  `ControlPlaneDO`. Making the control plane durable needs an async admin surface —
  a contract evolution the second adapter surfaced (exactly what D-14 is for), and
  the next step before deploying a real vertical.

- d929987: Control plane §4.3: entitlement store — `manifest.entitlementKey` finally gates loading

  `manifest.entitlementKey` was declared on every module and read by nothing (D-20
  was a promise with no mechanism). Now a per-tenant `_substrat_entitlements` set
  gates module loading, default-deny: an operation whose owning module's SKU flag
  the tenant does not hold does not resolve — the same fail-closed shape as manifest
  `withdraws`. New `HostAdmin.grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement` (idempotent,
  audited) and `listEntitlements`. The check runs per invoke (the simple, uncached
  path — a DO-cached variant is kernel-design open question 5). Entitlement flags
  are the SKUs meter 2 (§5) counts. Demo seeds grant the flags for the modules each
  vertical runs — the SKU model in use.

- f717014: Control plane §4.4: `PlatformActor` seam + append-only admin audit log (D-30, K-20)

  Every `HostAdmin` mutation (defineRole / assignRole / grant / grantToOrg / addMember)
  now takes a `PlatformActorId` — a staff subject branded distinctly from a tenant
  `PrincipalId` — and writes an append-only row to a new `_substrat_admin_log` in the
  directory, stamped host-side (actor, action, target, before/after, timestamp). A new
  `HostAdmin.auditLog(filter?)` reads it back — the read path for the console history and
  the permission-diff human checkpoint. `defineRole` captures the prior role in `before`.

  Pre-release breaking surface change kept at patch: `HostAdmin` method signatures gained
  a leading `actor` argument. Locally the actor is a dev stub; real staff auth gates
  exposing the surface, not building it.

- 6393a8e: Control plane §4.2: scope lifecycle + structural audit + mandatory tenant

  `provisionScope` becomes the first audited scope-lifecycle transition — it now
  takes a `PlatformActor`, requires an existing active tenant (a scope with no
  tenant record fails closed), and audits. New `HostAdmin.suspendScope`,
  `unsuspendScope`, `archiveScope`, and `unarchiveScope` implement the §3.3
  transitions, validate the legal transition graph (fail closed on an illegal
  one), and audit before/after; un-archive is an explicit restore, never a silent
  flag flip. `getScope` now gates on both tenant-active AND scope-active, so
  suspend/archive actually contain.

  Audit is now a single `recordAdmin` choke point every mutation routes through —
  "no mutation without a durable record" holds by construction, not per-method
  discipline. The step-2 "legacy scopes without a tenant" passthrough is removed:
  every scope has a tenant with a status.

- 2dd4175: Control plane §4.1: tenant registry + lifecycle status

  A real `tenants` table in the directory replaces "a tenant is a ULID nobody used
  before". New `HostAdmin.createTenant` (idempotent, audited), `setTenantStatus`,
  `listTenants`, and `getTenant`. A tenant whose status is not `active` fails
  `getScope` closed for every scope under it — the K-3 fail-closed path, the
  containment lever for non-payment or an incident, reversible without deletion.
  Scopes provisioned without a tenant record (legacy path) are not gated, keeping
  the change backward-compatible.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 604883b: Manifest-declared operation guards and operation withdrawal — compliance gates a reviewer can enumerate.

  A vertical declares an unconditional gate in its manifest (`guards: [{ before, predicate, config }]`); a module contributes the named predicate (`predicates` on `ModuleRegistration`, typed `GuardPredicate`); the kernel evaluates it inside the guarded operation's own transaction, before the handler, failing closed. `withdraws` lets a vertical suppress an engine's default operation binding so the guarded wrapper is the only door — without it a gate is reviewable but bypassable. Both are optional and additive: existing manifests parse and behave unchanged.

  The protocol engine gains a `protocol/all-signed` predicate and the `requireCountersigned` in-scope function; the work-order engine exports `closeWorkOrder` as an in-scope function (its `workorder/close` operation is now the thin binding). The scope-host contract suite covers guards and withdrawal, so every adapter must implement both.

- 7583dab: First end-to-end feature set: the kernel deltas that carry a running vertical.

    contributions on the module manifest, shared `money` schema with exact decimal
    arithmetic, attachment `visibility` classification.
  - **Kernel**: `registerModule` (manifest + migrations + operations + consumers),
    `OperationContext.link`, entity-aware `PermissionChecker`, `HostAdmin` surface for
    roles/assignments/grants/membership, `assertAllowed`/`PermissionDenied`.
  - **adapter-sqlite**: built-in constrained tuple permission engine (fixed four-rule
    algebra, proof paths, grant expiry, org membership), per-scope migration journal
    (lazy on wake, crash-safe), per-operation transactions (writes and emitted events
    commit or roll back together), local at-least-once event dispatch with a kernel
    delivery journal and system-actor consumer contexts.
  - **contract-tests**: atomicity, migration-journal, dispatch exactly-once, and tuple
    permission suites — every adapter must pass all of them unchanged.
  - **Engines**: first releases of `@substrat-run/engine-workorder` (state machine, append-only
    time/material, fat completion events) and `@substrat-run/engine-invoicing` (event-consuming
    snapshot fakturaunderlag with provenance, immutable once exported).
